In order to\\neffectively improve the software processes, different approaches have been developed, of which\\nsoftware process\\nthe SPI, many\\norganizations use existing models and standards, such as ISO 9000 series of standards [18] and\\nthe Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) [8]. These models and standards have a\\ncommon approach in terms of quality and process improvement with different emphases [17].\\nFor instance, ISO standard addresses the minimum criteria for a quality software while the\\nCMMI emphasizes improvement in different levels [56]. It is hard to decide which one is better\\nthese models and standards depends on organization’s priorities and\\nas\\nmotivation [53].\\n\\nthe most widely used [30]. For\\n\\nthe selection of\\n\\nResearch shows that only a small proportion of the software developing organization’s population\\nhas adopted SPI models and framework. This is depicted in the Software Engineering Institute (SEI)\\nCMMI appraisal report\\nin which only 3113 CMMI appraisals were reported to the SEI [50].\\nResearch also shows that a large majority of software development organizations are facing\\nproblems in the implementation of SPI initiatives based on process capability maturity models like\\nCMMI [54]. In addition, small-sized and medium-sized organizations have many concerns of the\\nrelevance and applicability of models like CMMI [7, 43, 54]. One of the biggest challenges is that\\nan SPI program is a high-priced undertaking, and organizations need to commit signiﬁcant resources\\nover a long time period [9]. In addition, the failure rate of SPI initiatives is also very high, estimated\\nas 70% [28, 49].\\n\\nThere are limited number of studies that have discussed different SPI implementation problems and\\ntheir solutions. Recently, a study was conducted to explore how human aspects can inﬂuence SPI\\nprograms [10]. Pino et al. [43] have developed an assessment methodology for SPI in small\\norganizations. Pettersson et al. [42] have developed a step-by-step guide to process assessment and\\nimprovement planning. Shih and Huang [52] have explored the relationship between organizational\\nculture and SPI deployment and found that the organizational culture had an inﬂuence on SPI\\ndeployment. A study was conducted to identify what motivate and de-motivate practitioners to use\\nSPI approaches [2, 3]. In other studies, SPI implementation barriers [32, 40] and SPI success factors\\nwere identiﬁed [39].\\n\\nresearchers to design their\\n\\nIt has been observed in previous research that to successfully implement SPI initiatives, one\\nneeds to be more aware of factors that can play a positive role in SPI implementation [32]. This\\ncan assist\\nresearch projects within an appropriate context. The\\nknowledge of SPI success factors can help to develop new or improved SPI implementation\\napproaches, whose adoption will better match organization’s objectives, and also may help to\\ncommunicate a compelling case to organizations making decisions about adopting SPI [34]. The\\nobjective of this paper is to present a comparative study of SPI success factors as identiﬁed by\\nthe three study strategies, that is, informal literature review, formal literature review (SLR), and\\ninterviews.\\n\\nThe focus of this paper is based on the following research questions:\\n\\nRQ1. What factors, as identiﬁed in the informal\\n\\nliterature review, have a positive impact on\\n\\nRQ2. What factors, as identiﬁed in the formal\\n\\nliterature review, have a positive impact on\\n\\nimplementing SPI?\\n\\nimplementing SPI?\\n\\nRQ3.

INTRODUCTION\\n\\nis\\n\\n(SPI)\\n\\nimprovement\\n\\nMany software companies rely on the continuous improvement and tailoring of their software\\nprocesses in order to develop higher-quality software more efﬁciently [17, 20]. In order to\\neffectively improve the software processes, different approaches have been developed, of which\\nsoftware process\\nthe SPI, many\\norganizations use existing models and standards, such as ISO 9000 series of standards [18] and\\nthe Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) [8]. These models and standards have a\\ncommon approach in terms of quality and process improvement with different emphases [17].\\nFor instance, ISO standard addresses the minimum criteria for a quality software while the\\nCMMI emphasizes improvement in different levels [56]. It is hard to decide which one is better\\nthese models and standards depends on organization’s priorities and\\nas\\nmotivation [53].\\n\\nthe most widely used [30]. For\\n\\nthe selection of\\n\\nResearch shows that only a small proportion of the software developing organization’s population\\nhas adopted SPI models and framework. This is depicted in the Software Engineering Institute (SEI)\\nCMMI appraisal report\\nin which only 3113 CMMI appraisals were reported to the SEI [50].\\nResearch also shows that a large majority of software development organizations are facing\\nproblems in the implementation of SPI initiatives based on process capability maturity models like\\nCMMI [54]. In addition, small-sized and medium-sized organizations have many concerns of the\\nrelevance and applicability of models like CMMI [7, 43, 54]. One of the biggest challenges is that\\nan SPI program is a high-priced undertaking, and organizations need to commit signiﬁcant resources\\nover a long time period [9]. In addition, the failure rate of SPI initiatives is also very high, estimated\\nas 70% [28, 49].\\n\\nThere are limited number of studies that have discussed different SPI implementation problems and\\ntheir solutions. Recently, a study was conducted to explore how human aspects can inﬂuence SPI\\nprograms [10]. Pino et al. [43] have developed an assessment methodology for SPI in small\\norganizations. Pettersson et al. [42] have developed a step-by-step guide to process assessment and\\nimprovement planning. Shih and Huang [52] have explored the relationship between organizational\\nculture and SPI deployment and found that the organizational culture had an inﬂuence on SPI\\ndeployment. A study was conducted to identify what motivate and de-motivate practitioners to use\\nSPI approaches [2, 3]. In other studies, SPI implementation barriers [32, 40] and SPI success factors\\nwere identiﬁed [39].\\n\\nresearchers to design their\\n\\nIt has been observed in previous research that to successfully implement SPI initiatives, one\\nneeds to be more aware of factors that can play a positive role in SPI implementation [32]. This\\ncan assist\\nresearch projects within an appropriate context. The\\nknowledge of SPI success factors can help to develop new or improved SPI implementation\\napproaches, whose adoption will better match organization’s objectives, and also may help to\\ncommunicate a compelling case to organizations making decisions about adopting SPI [34]. The\\nobjective of this paper is to present a comparative study of SPI success factors as identiﬁed by\\nthe three study strategies, that is, informal literature review, formal literature review (SLR), and\\ninterviews.\\n\\nThe focus of this paper is based on the following research questions:\\n\\nRQ1.

MOTIVATION\\n\\nSoftware process improvement programs intend to help organizations to develop higher-quality\\nsoftware more effectively and efﬁciently. Given the signiﬁcant role and importance of SPI for\\nimproving organizational competencies and competitiveness, several SPI frameworks and models\\nhave been developed to guide, design, implement, monitor, and improve software development\\nprocesses. Process capability maturity models such as CMMI [51] and ISO/IEC 15504 (SPICE) are\\nSPI frameworks for deﬁning and measuring processes and practices that can be used by software\\ndevelopment organizations. Research shows that the effort put into SPI can assist in producing high-\\nquality software, reducing cost and time, and increasing productivity [1, 18, 43]. However, SPI\\ninitiatives may not produce the desired results despite committing the required amount of resources\\n[14, 45].\\n\\nFor achieving the desired results from SPI initiatives, it is vital to pay sufﬁcient attention to human\\naspects of SPI implementation strategies [15, 34, 38, 57]. SPI researchers and practitioners need to\\nidentify and understand the factors that can play a key role in successful SPI initiatives. It is argued\\nthat SPI has a higher chance of success in companies where practitioners are highly motivated for\\nsupporting SPI [44]. A good knowledge of such SPI factors is expected to help develop new or\\nimproved SPI implementation strategies. Because there can be several factors that can play a vital\\nrole in successful SPI projects, we assert that it is equally important to identify and understand the\\nperceived value of different factors considered to play a key role in the success of SPI project. Such\\nknowledge of the relative importance of different SPI factors is expected to help SPI managers to\\nprioritize the allocation of their resources based on the perceived importance of each of the SPI\\nfactors. In addition, the SPI factors and their relative value also need to be understood from different\\ngeographical and cultural aspects due to the adoption of global software development (GSD)\\ninitiatives [11, 22, 26].\\n\\nto become internationally competitive and attract outsourced projects\\n\\nMany software vendor organizations involved in GSD are likely to implement SPI initiatives in\\norder\\n[5]. CMMI\\ncertiﬁcation is expected to signiﬁcantly improve an organization’s chances of gaining new\\ncontracts [21]. It has also been shown that different levels of software development maturity\\nbetween GSD organizations can have negative impact on the software development process and\\nproject success [47]. Hence, SPI initiatives have increasingly important role in the context of\\nGSD. We assert that there is an important need to gain an in-depth understanding of different\\naspects of successfully implementing SPI in companies involved not only in in-house software\\ndevelopment but also in GSD.\\n\\nWe designed a large research project consisting of different studies aimed at different sets of human-\\ncentric factors that may have negative or positive impact on successfully implementing SPI programs\\nin software development companies. Our decision was to approach the research objective by ﬁrst\\nconcentrating on complementing and/or extending the existing knowledge about the SPI factors\\nreported by other researchers [2, 3, 20]. We reported the ﬁndings on the factors that can be\\nconsidered barriers to SPI implementation efforts [31] and the factors that may de-motivate SPI\\npractitioners from supporting the SPI programs [33]. We have also reported success factors that can\\nplay a positive role in SPI implementation [38].\\n\\nAfter\\n\\nreporting the preliminary ﬁndings as discussed earlier, we decided to perform a\\ncomparative study of SPI success factors. This will not only identify what constitutes SPI\\nproject success but also produce a set of guidelines for successful SPI projects. The work\\nproposed will advance the disparate work that has been undertaken on SPI projects. The\\noutcomes of the project will provide other researchers in the world with a solid knowledge on\\nwhich to develop different SPI activities that are based on an understanding of how and where\\nthey ﬁt into the SPI projects. New SPI practices will then be developed, addressing the high\\nnumber of failures currently reported for SPI projects. In addition, the paper outcomes will assist\\nSPI managers with ability to understand the strengths and weaknesses of current SPI projects\\nand to address areas that need attention. Improvement can then be implemented on a rational\\nand targeted basis. Ultimately, this work will put SPI organizations in a better position to deliver\\nwhat customers want.\\n\\nCopyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\\n\\nJ. Softw.

RESEARCH DESIGN\\n\\n3.1. Data collection via informal literature reviews\\n\\nIn previous research [38], 47 published experience reports, case studies, and articles were identiﬁed via\\nsnowballing in order to identify factors that can play a positive role in the implementation of SPI\\nprograms. Each paper was reviewed carefully, and a list of factors that played a positive role in the\\nSPI implementation was generated. There were three categories of papers. The ﬁrst category\\nconsisted of papers in which the authors have described their SPI implementation experiences with\\nlessons learned, that is, how they achieved capability maturity model (CMM) level 3, why their SPI\\nimplementation program was successful, and so on. From the papers identiﬁed in this study, it was\\nfairly easy to identify factors that played a positive role in SPI implementation because, often,\\nauthors provided a summary of factors in the lessons learned.\\n\\nThe second category consisted of papers in which SPI implementation was discussed but any\\nsummary of factors was not discussed. In this case, each paper was read carefully to identify these\\nfactors.\\n\\nThe ﬁnal category consisted of a few papers in which the results of empirical studies were described\\nwhere it was very easy to identify factors. For example, Hall et al. [15] present survey data\\ncharacterizing the implementation of SPI in 85 UK companies and found that 89% respondents were\\nagreed to have proper resources for SPI: ‘it is important that SPI is properly resourced’.\\n\\nIn order to analyze the extracted data, a frequency analysis technique was used.\\nThe informal literature review process was completed in June 2004.\\n\\n3.2. Data collection via formal literature reviews\\nFor formal literature review, the SLR process was used [23, 58]. A systematic review is ‘a means of\\nevaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area\\nor phenomenon of interest’ [23]. A systematic review can also discover the structure and patterns of\\nexisting research and so identify gaps that can be ﬁlled by future research [12, 23]. SLRs differ from\\nliterature reviews in being formally planned and methodically executed. In ﬁnding,\\ninformal\\nevaluating, and summarizing all available evidence, an SLR may provide a greater level of validity\\nin its ﬁndings than might be possible in an informal\\nliterature review. An SLR protocol was\\ndesigned ﬁrst in order to perform the SLR (Appendix A).\\n\\nKitchenham and Charters [23] described the three main phases of a systematic review process:\\nplanning the review, conducting the review, and reporting the review. Each of these phases contains\\na sequence of stages, but the execution of the overall process involves iteration, feedback, and\\nreﬁnement of the deﬁned process.\\n\\nThe output from the planning phase is an SLR protocol that deﬁnes how the review should be\\nconducted. An SLR protocol is a formal document for the execution of the systematic review. A\\npredeﬁned protocol can reduce the possibility of researcher bias [23]. The contents of the SLR\\nprotocol can assist in designing the structure of the ﬁnal report as it describes the need for an SLR,\\nbackground of research,\\nthe research questions to be investigated, search strategy, criteria for\\ninclusion and exclusion, publication quality assessment, the data extraction process, and the data\\nsynthesis process.\\n\\nIn the conducting phase, the SLR protocol is implemented to generate the results such as the initial\\nselection process, the list of ﬁnally selected publications, information of quality assessments, and\\nextracted data for each of the selected publications. In this phase, those primary studies that provide\\ndirect evidence about the research questions are identiﬁed. The selection of primary studies is a\\nmultistage process in which the clearly irrelevant articles are excluded and then only those articles\\nthat contain extractable data addressing the research questions are included. After selecting the\\nprimary studies, often, checklists are used to assess the quality of the article. The extracted data are\\ngrouped in order to answer the research questions\\n\\nCopyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\\n\\nJ. Softw.

The structure and contents of reports are presented in the\\nguidelines [23].\\n\\nIn order to analyze the SLR data, the frequency analysis technique was used. The number and\\npercentages of each factor were reported in the form of frequency tables. The use of frequency\\nanalysis was helpful in comparing and contrasting different SPI factors within groups of variables or\\nacross groups of variables.\\n\\nIn total, 38 relevant articles were identiﬁed via the SLR process as shown in Table I and Appendix\\nD. For formal literature reviews, the SLR was conducted by applying customized search strings\\ncovering the time to June 30, 2004 (this is the deadline of the informal literature review).\\n\\n3.3. Data collection via interviews\\n\\nIn order to conﬁrm the ﬁndings of literature and to have more conﬁdence in the results, 34 interviews\\nwith 29 organizations were conducted. The sample proﬁle is shown in Appendix C. The practitioners\\ninto three categories: ‘developers’, ‘managers’, and ‘senior\\nparticipated in these interviews fall\\nmanagers’.\\n\\nIn total, 224 letters were sent out to participants, and only 34 SPI practitioners responded. The\\nsample proﬁle available in the target population in this research was SPI practitioners who had\\ninitiated SPI programs. Questioning was both open and close ended with frequent probing to\\nelaborate and clarify meaning. The interview questions were tested in a pilot study with two SPI\\npractitioners. The negotiated interview duration was half an hour; however, the researcher and\\ninterviewee would determine the pace of the interview. Approval for the interviews was gained from\\nthe host organizations. The participants gave their consent to record their interviews and agreed to\\nthe publication of the results subject to anonymity. These interviews were conducted in early 2004.\\n\\n4.

The results also show that\\n‘staff time and resources’ (38%) and ‘creating process action teams’ (31%) are also important SPI\\nsuccess factors. It was also found that more than 25% of the articles in the informal literature review\\nhave mentioned ‘reviews’, ‘experienced staff’, ‘clear and relevant SPI goals’, and ‘assigning of\\nresponsibilities’ as SPI success factors.\\n\\nTable I.

Software process improvement success factors identiﬁed via the formal literature review\\n\\nInitially, more than 50 SPI success factors were identiﬁed via the formal literature review. After\\ncarefully reviewing each factor using the qualitative grounded theory approach [54], 34 SPI success\\nfactors were identiﬁed. This whole process was performed by a single researcher with a feedback\\nfrom three other experienced researchers.\\n\\nTable III shows the list of SPI factors identiﬁed via the SLR. This table shows that, like the informal\\nliterature review, the most frequently mentioned SPI success factor in the SLR is ‘senior management\\ncommitment’, that is, 68%.\\n\\nOne new frequently mentioned success factor—‘SPI awareness’—was identiﬁed in this formal\\nliterature review, which was not identiﬁed in the previous informal literature review. There is a great\\nneed for awareness of SPI programs in order to fully understand the beneﬁts of SPI. This is because\\nSPI implementation is an expensive and long-term approach and it takes a long time to realize the\\nreal beneﬁts of this approach. Hence, in order to obtain the support of management and practitioners\\nand to successfully continue SPI initiatives, it is very important to provide sufﬁcient awareness at\\nthe very beginning of SPI implementation programs. SPI implementation is not as beneﬁcial without\\nsufﬁcient awareness of its beneﬁts.\\n\\nMore than half of the articles in the formal literature review described ‘managing the SPI project’ as\\na success factor for SPI implementation. In the SPI projects, an effective project management plays a\\nvital role as managing geographical distributed teams can be difﬁcult. Ofer and Arik [40] have found\\nthat improving the project planning is an effective tool in dealing with high-risk projects. Sun-Jen and\\nWen-Ming [56] have reported the impact of project planning on project duration. Linda et al. [25] have\\ndescribed the ‘lack of project planning’ as a risk to software projects.\\n\\nOther frequently mentioned factors found from the analysis of the selected studies are ‘reviews’ and\\n‘staff involvement’. ‘Reviews’ are important to continuously monitor process with emerging and new\\ntrends. ‘Staff involvement’ is critical for staff satisfaction and to exchange of ideas.\\n\\n4.3.

Comparing software process improvement success factors identiﬁed via different research\\nstrategies\\n\\nApart from identifying and understanding SPI success factors by an individual research strategy, we\\nalso compare the SPI success factors as identiﬁed by the three research strategies.

A\\ntotal of 18 success factors have been identiﬁed via the informal literature review, 34 success factors\\nhave been identiﬁed via the formal literature review, and 22 success factors have been identiﬁed via\\ninterviews. This shows that the formal literature review has identiﬁed more factors and, hence, was\\nmore thorough than the informal literature review and interviews.\\n\\nIn order to ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences between the three research strategies, the chi-squared test\\nwas used as this test checks if different samples are different (not different) enough in some\\n\\nCopyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\\n\\nJ.

A number of signiﬁcant differences were found\\nbetween the three research strategies (i.e., p value in Appendix B is highlighted for signiﬁcant\\ndifferences).\\n\\nWhen comparing formal and informal literature reviews, it is very clear from Table V that there are\\nboth similarities and differences in factors between the two research strategies. ‘Senior management\\ncommitment’ is equal, top most cited SPI success factor by formal and informal literature review.\\nThe other most frequently cited common SPI factors are ‘staff involvement’, ‘reviews’, and ‘creating\\nprocess action teams’. Using Appendix B, it is clear that 53% factors are common between the two\\nresearch strategies and 47% factors are only cited by an individual research strategy (formal and\\ninformal literature reviews). Our results show that 29% factors have signiﬁcant differences while\\n71% factors have no signiﬁcant difference between the two research strategies. The frequencies in\\nAppendix B show that the informal literature review has identiﬁed more articles (i.e., 47) than the\\nformal literature review (i.e., 38). This may be due to the fact that designing the search string is\\nalways difﬁcult on the formal literature review. It is always hard to ﬁnd a search string that retrieves\\nall the relevant papers in the formal literature review as too restrictive search strings often reduce the\\nnumber of identiﬁed articles [25]. In addition, as in the informal literature review process, the\\nsnowballing technique, which enabled the identiﬁcation of a sufﬁcient number of papers, was used.\\nIn addition, in the formal literature review, the CrossTalk source was not included because of its\\n\\nTable V.

Table VI shows that Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcient, rs, is 0.517 and that\\nit is statistically signiﬁcant (p = 0.001). As the Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcient is close to 1, that\\nis, 0.517, this shows the strong positive correlation between the results obtained from the two\\nresearch strategies, that is, formal and informal literature reviews. This also shows that the ranks of\\nformal and informal literature reviews tend to increase or decrease together (rs(37) = 0.517).\\n\\nTable VII shows that there are similarities and differences in factors when comparing interviews and\\ninformal literature. ‘Senior management commitment’ is the top most cited SPI success factor by\\nliterature review. ‘Training and mentoring’, ‘staff time and resources’,\\ninterviews and informal\\n‘experienced staff’, and ‘staff involvement’ are other frequently cited common SPI factors between\\ninterviews and informal literature research strategies. It is clear from Appendix B that 33% factors\\nare common between the two research strategies (interviews and informal literature) and 67% factors\\nare only cited by an individual research strategy.

There are several accounts that\\ndescribe the importance of higher management support for SPI implementation. A few of the key\\nstudies are described as follows:\\n\\n(cid:129) Basili et al. [4] describe the 13 lessons learned from 25 years of process improvement experience\\nat the NASA software engineering laboratory and emphasize senior management commitment for\\nSPI: ‘having upper management support is important for continued success’ [4].\\n\\n(cid:129) According to Pitterman [43], ‘without high levels of senior management commitment to a quality\\n\\nsystem, most quality improvement efforts are doomed to fail’ [43].\\n\\nTable VI.

This shows that the data extraction process in the formal literature review\\nwas more thorough than the informal literature review. Awareness of SPI is critical to continuously\\nobtain the support of staff members in SPI initiatives.\\n\\n4.5. Summary of results and discussion\\n\\nThis research has been motivated by the challenges faced by companies in implementing SPI programs\\n[4, 43]. This study has identiﬁed the SPI success factors from the three research strategies. The\\nobjective of this paper is to present a comparative study of SPI success factors as identiﬁed by the\\nthree study strategies. Success factors represent some of the key areas where management should\\nfocus their attention in order to better design SPI initiatives [43]. In order to decide the criticality of\\nan SPI success factor, the following criterion was used:\\n\\n(cid:129) If an SPI success factor is cited with a frequency percentage of ≥50%, then we treat success factor\\n\\nas a critical success factor (CSF) in this explorative study.\\n\\nThe similar criterion was used in my previous research [21, 24, 28, 30, 36–38]. It is believed that a\\nbetter understanding of the criticality of SPI success factors identiﬁed in different research strategies\\nshould be taken into consideration while designing and implementing an SPI program. The\\ncriticality of SPI success factors can act as a guide for SPI program managers when designing and\\nimplementing SPI initiatives. The assertion behind this argument\\nit will be easier to\\nencourage the use of those SPI factors that are critical.\\n\\nis that\\n\\nIn order to address RQ1, using the aforementioned criterion, two CSFs that are generally considered\\ncritical for SPI implementation were identiﬁed in the informal literature. These CSFs are senior\\nmanagement commitment (66%) and staff involvement (51%).\\n\\nFor RQ2, using the criterion for CSFs (≥50%), three CSFs were identiﬁed in the formal literature\\nreview, that is, senior management commitment (68%), SPI awareness (58%), and managing the SPI\\nproject (55%).\\n\\nTable VIII.

Participants in this study (interviews) suggested\\nthat the following guidelines should be used in order to implement CSFs identiﬁed in the three\\nresearch strategies.\\n\\n4.5.1.

LIMITATIONS\\n\\nHow valid are our ﬁndings of SPI implementation success factors? Construct validity is concerned\\nwith whether or not the measurement scales represent the attributes being measured.

The analysis of the data gathered from the three research\\nstrategies revealed that all the attributes considered were relevant to SPI implementation.

The results of the pilot studies\\nprovide an acceptable level of internal validity as the variables included in this study were taken\\nfrom extensive literature review and piloting of questions. External validity is concerned with the\\ngeneralization of the results to other environments than the one in which the initial study was\\nconducted. For examining the external validity, the data were gathered using the three research\\nstrategies, that is, 34 interviews with SPI practitioners, formal review of 38 articles, and informal\\nreview of 47 articles. However, interviews were only conducted with Australian SPI practitioners.\\nThe SPI practitioners were selected as the representatives of a typical Australian software\\ndevelopment company who were doing SPI activities. However, a sample size of 34 practitioners\\nis relatively small to be able to sufﬁciently address the generalization issue. To gain a broader\\nrepresentation of the SPI practitioner’s views on this topic, formal and informal literature reviews\\nwere conducted.\\n\\nto reduce the researcher’s bias. Two independent\\n\\nLike any other empirical study, this study also has certain limitations, which should be taken\\ninto consideration when interpreting or using the reporting ﬁndings for practice or research. In\\nthe SLR, during the selection of primary studies and data extraction, the inter-rater reliability\\ntests were performed in order\\nreviewers\\nselected 10 publications randomly and performed the selection and data extraction processes.\\nKendall’s coefﬁcient of concordance (W) [13] for the 10 randomly selected publications was\\n0.88 (p = 0.004), which indicates a good degree of agreement between the results produced by\\nthe primary researcher and the independent reviewers. However, it was not possible to check\\neach and every paper by the secondary reviewer. One possible limitation in SLR is that for\\nany speciﬁc article, their reported success factors may not have in fact described underlying\\nreason. It was hard to independently control this threat. The authors of these studies were not\\nsupposed to report\\nreasons why these success factors were used during SPI\\nimplementation. It is also possible that in some studies, there may have been a tendency for\\nparticular kinds of success factors to be reported. Many of the contributing studies were self-\\nreported experience reports, case studies, and empirical studies, which may be subject\\nto\\npublication bias.\\n\\nthe original\\n\\nIn the interviews, experiences and perceptions of practitioners regarding SPI implementation were\\nexplored. These perceptions and experiences have not been veriﬁed directly. This may mean that\\nwhat the practitioners state as success factors may not necessarily be the success factors for SPI\\nimplementation. Furthermore, practitioner’s perceptions may not be accurate.\\n\\n6. CONCLUSION\\n\\nIn this paper, the comparative study of SPI implementation success factors was conducted using three\\nresearch strategies. It is suggested that implementation of these factors can help software development\\nin successfully implementing SPI initiatives.\\n\\nThis paper provides an in-depth analysis aimed at exploring and understanding SPI\\nimplementation success factors. The data were gathered using the three research strategies, that\\nis, interviews, informal literature review, and formal literature review. The results have identiﬁed\\nthe factors that can play a vital role in SPI implementation initiatives. This study was also aimed\\nat identifying a small set of success factors, which can be considered more important based on\\nthe notion of ‘CSFs’.\\n\\nThe ﬁrst research question for this research was as follows: what factors, as identiﬁed in the\\ninformal literature review, have a positive impact on implementing SPI? Based on the notion of the\\n‘CSF’ value of each of the identiﬁed factors, two CSFs that are generally considered critical for SPI\\nimplementation were identiﬁed in the informal literature. These CSFs are as follows: (i) senior\\nmanagement commitment (66%) and (ii) staff involvement (51%).\\n\\nThe second research question was as follows: what factors, as identiﬁed in the formal literature\\nreview, have a negative impact on implementing SPI? The results from the analysis of the data\\ngathered for RQ2 have been shown in Table III. The results show that in the formal literature\\n\\nCopyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\\n\\nJ. Softw.

The\\nresults show that SPI practitioners consider the following: (i) senior management commitment\\n(68%);\\ntraining and mentoring (68%); and (iii) SPI awareness (59%) as CSFs for SPI\\nimplementation.\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nThe next research question, RQ4, intended to explore the variations, if any, among SPI success\\nfactors based on the study strategies used: RQ4. How are these factors related to the methodology\\nused? Only one CSF, which is common in all research strategies, was identiﬁed, that is, senior\\nmanagement commitment. Staff involvement is also a frequently cited common SPI success factor\\nin all three research strategies.\\n\\nThe objective of this research is to provide SPI managers with a body of knowledge that can help\\nthem to design and implement successful SPI initiatives. To gain a broader representation of\\npractitioner’s views on this topic, we have a plan to carry out similar studies in other continents,\\nespecially in India and the USA, which have the highest number of CMMI appraisals. The overall\\nresults of this study are expected to help SPI managers to understand the usage of SPI success\\nfactors as well as help them to compare SPI success factors in other regions.\\n\\nAPPENDIX A: Systematic literature review protocol\\n\\nA systematic review protocol was written to describe the plan for the review.

approach to addressing the challenges such as late feedback, slow project  timelines,  and  high  cost,  typically  associated  with  software  development  projects.\\', \\'however, when projects are implemented using an agile model with distributed human resources, there are a number of challenges that need to be considered and mitigated.\\', \\'objectives:  the  objectives  of  our  work  are  multifold.\\', \\'first,  we  would  like  to  understand  the reasons and conditions that lead to the adoption of distributed agile software engineering practices.\\', \\'second,  we  would  like  to  investigate  and  find  out  the  most  important  risks  that  threaten  a distributed  agile  software  engineering  approach  and  what  mitigation  strategies  exist  to  address them.\\', \\'finally, would like to highlight which of the available approaches among the existing agile methodologies  have  been  successfully  adopted  by  the  community.\\', \\'we  intend  to  solidify  our findings by exploring the strength of the evidence that has been reported in the literature.\\', \\'methods:  we carried out a systematic literature review of distributed agile software engineering techniques and approaches reported from january 1, 2007 until september 31, 2012.\\', \\'the adopted method follows the well-established guidelines in the literature for conducting systematic literature reviews.\\', \\'results:  sixty-three  distinct  studies  were  selected  and  analyzed  according  to  the  inclusion  and exclusion criteria, which focused on identifying only those studies from the literature that had a significant empirical or experimental aspect to them.\\', \\'the results revealed a significant number of scenarios reported by the industry that documented challenges and solutions in a distributed agile setting.\\', \\'communication, coordination, collaboration, and cultural issues were listed as being the areas where challenges exist.\\', \\'conclusions:  this  systematic  literature  review  found  time  zone  difference,  knowledge  of resources, lack of infrastructure, missing roles and responsibilities as being the primary challenges that needed to be addressed.\\', \\'in terms of solutions, most papers had recommended having a good infrastructure  in  place  for  communication,  encouraging  team  members  to  engage  in  formal  and informal communications, having more face-to-face visits, training human resources on dase and organizational  practices,  policies,  procedures,  and  utilizing  tools  to  enhance  the  collaboration 1 cexperience.\\', \\'additionally, this research provides recommendations to help improve the current state of reporting findings and results in the distributed agile software engineering domain.\\', \\'keywords: distributed agile software engineering, empirical results, surveys and field studies, agile, dase, systematic literature review 1.\\', \\'introduction  in  the  last  decade,  research  on  distributed  software  engineering  (dse)  (or  dsd  –  distributed software  development)  has  evolved  rapidly.\\', \\'cheaper  labor,  access  to  global  talent,  increase  in business, faster delivery, and follow-the-sun development are just some of the many reasons why companies choose to engage in dse.\\', \\'however, there are challenges that organizations face with such  engagement.\\', \\'challenges  such  as  economic  instability,  technological,  organizational, communication,  team  trust,  and  cultural  issues  need  to  be  tackled  by  organizations  and  teams involved in distributed development.\\', \\'despite the recent growth of this topic, distributed software development is still evolving.\\', \\'as such, the failure rate of dse projects is higher than collocated projects [77].\\', \\'dse allows the client organization to engage in activities across one or more remote sites [77].\\', \\'the combination of remote sites forms a network of sub-teams or remote teams that work together on a common goal.\\', \\'when dsd is implemented using agile methodologies, such as scrum or xp, the  challenges  increase.\\', \\'for  instance,  the  coordination  of  tasks  between  teams  becomes  a  more challenging endeavor for project managers and leads [77].\\', \\'before dse and outsourcing gained momentum, organizations used to outsource work to a vendor that  performed  single  basic  functions.\\', \\'the  first  documented  outsourcing  was  in  1963  between electronic  data  systems  (eds)  and  bluecross  blue  shield  of  pennsylvania  where  eds  was responsible  for  managing  bluecross’  data  [79].\\', \\'following  the  success  of  this  initiative,  eds started to receive intake work from companies like frito-lay and general motors.\\', \\'this is when large-scale  outsourcing became  noticeable.\\', \\'in the late 1980s,  ibm signed a  deal  with kodak to outsource their technology initiatives [79].\\', \\'the commonality between these deals were that they were total outsourcing, where there is a transfer of the work, human resources and management, as opposed to a project, components of a project, or augmenting human resources.\\', \\'as  requirements  became  intense,  software  construction  became  more  complicated.\\', \\'to  make matters more complex, several companies were formed in the 1990s that had specific skills or had distribution rights on software [79].\\', \\'this forced companies who wished to integrate or purchase such  software  to  engage  in  deals  with  these  specialized  companies.\\', \\'this  resulted  in  companies such as kodak, general motors, ibm, and eds working with multiple vendors, which led to the introduction  of  dse  and  the  birth  of  several  fields,  such  as  contract  management,  customer relations,  auditing,  and  benchmarking  [79].\\', \\'although  gartner  group  reports  that  70%  of 2 ccompanies engage in some form of outsourcing, they estimate that a significant proportion of these companies will also have to renegotiate their contracts [78].\\', \\'agile  methodologies  are  undertaken  by  organizations  that  are  interested  in  delivering  business value  regularly  and  often  [85].\\', \\'additionally,  organizations  can  quickly  assess  the  value  of  the product  early  on  and  decide  on  the  fate  of  the  project  without  spending  too  much  money.\\', \\'the product owners focus on prioritizing the functionality, such that the core value of the project is delivered in the early releases; therefore, increasing value to the organization.\\', \\'as the market trend changes, the team can quickly adapt to the change.\\', \\'agile projects are known to decrease overall portfolio cost by cancelling projects and programs early on therefore emphasizing on those projects that have a good return on investment [14][23].\\', \\'the core practice of agile methodologies, such as xp, is that they prefer collocation of human resources,  less  documentation,  and  face-to-face  interaction  thereby  eliminating  communication related delays, and creating team cohesion [44].\\', \\'if the above is true, then xp projects can eliminate the need for extensive and formal requirements analysis and entire design of the system early on [49].\\', \\'in each iteration or sprint, the project team will analyze, design, develop, and test only the functionality  that  is  part  of  the  sprint.\\', \\'as  functionality  is  developed,  it  is  integrated  with  the previously  delivered  functionality  and  validated.\\', \\'at  the  end  of  the  sprint,  deployment  into production is scheduled resulting in quick feedback from the customers and other stakeholders.\\', \\'projects  that  engage  in  dse  are  bound  to  face  many  challenges  [14][23].\\', \\'even  with  these challenges, organizations wish to engage in dse due to cost savings (40%), capacity of remote teams (20%), application knowledge (13%), and quick time to market (11%) [66].\\', \\'[65] defines the characteristics of dse as the following: • • • • • • • multi-sourcing  –  multiple  distributed  member  involvement  in  a  joint  project; characterized by a number of collaboration partners.\\', \\'geographic distribution – partners are located far away from each other.\\', \\'temporal diversity – characterized by the level of working hours overlay.\\', \\'socio-cultural diversity – level of social, ethnic and, cultural fit.\\', \\'linguistic diversity – characterized by the level of language skills.\\', \\'contextual  diversity  – level  of  organizational fit  (diversity in  process  maturity and work practices).\\', \\'political  and  legislative  diversity  -  effect  of  cross  border  collaboration  due  to political threats or threats associated with incompatibility of laws.\\', \\'organizations that wish to engage in dse could find that agile methods provide the flexibility that  they  need  [31][83].\\', \\'however,  the  principles  of  dse  and  agile  are  not  always  necessarily compatible  [18].\\', \\'there  is  no  collocation  amongst  team  members  resulting  in  no  face-to-face interaction.\\', \\'team  cohesion  does  not  exist  due  to  cultural  and  language  issues.\\', \\'informal communication  is  also  not  certain

software  development  via  remote teams represents an emerging approach to addressing the challenges such as late feedback, slow project  timelines,  and  high  cost,  typically  associated  with  software  development  projects.\", \\'however, when projects are implemented using an agile model with distributed human resources, there are a number of challenges that need to be considered and mitigated.\\', \\'objectives:  the  objectives  of  our  work  are  multifold.\\', \\'first,  we  would  like  to  understand  the reasons and conditions that lead to the adoption of distributed agile software engineering practices.\\', \\'second,  we  would  like  to  investigate  and  find  out  the  most  important  risks  that  threaten  a distributed  agile  software  engineering  approach  and  what  mitigation  strategies  exist  to  address them.\\', \\'finally, would like to highlight which of the available approaches among the existing agile methodologies  have  been  successfully  adopted  by  the  community.\\', \\'we  intend  to  solidify  our findings by exploring the strength of the evidence that has been reported in the literature.\\', \\'methods:  we carried out a systematic literature review of distributed agile software engineering techniques and approaches reported from january 1, 2007 until september 31, 2012.\\', \\'the adopted method follows the well-established guidelines in the literature for conducting systematic literature reviews.\\', \\'results:  sixty-three  distinct  studies  were  selected  and  analyzed  according  to  the  inclusion  and exclusion criteria, which focused on identifying only those studies from the literature that had a significant empirical or experimental aspect to them.\\', \\'the results revealed a significant number of scenarios reported by the industry that documented challenges and solutions in a distributed agile setting.\\', \\'communication, coordination, collaboration, and cultural issues were listed as being the areas where challenges exist.\\', \\'conclusions:  this  systematic  literature  review  found  time  zone  difference,  knowledge  of resources, lack of infrastructure, missing roles and responsibilities as being the primary challenges that needed to be addressed.\\', \\'in terms of solutions, most papers had recommended having a good infrastructure  in  place  for  communication,  encouraging  team  members  to  engage  in  formal  and informal communications, having more face-to-face visits, training human resources on dase and organizational  practices,  policies,  procedures,  and  utilizing  tools  to  enhance  the  collaboration 1 cexperience.\\', \\'additionally, this research provides recommendations to help improve the current state of reporting findings and results in the distributed agile software engineering domain.\\', \\'keywords: distributed agile software engineering, empirical results, surveys and field studies, agile, dase, systematic literature review 1.\\', \\'introduction  in  the  last  decade,  research  on  distributed  software  engineering  (dse)  (or  dsd  –  distributed software  development)  has  evolved  rapidly.\\', \\'cheaper  labor,  access  to  global  talent,  increase  in business, faster delivery, and follow-the-sun development are just some of the many reasons why companies choose to engage in dse.\\', \\'however, there are challenges that organizations face with such  engagement.\\', \\'challenges  such  as  economic  instability,  technological,  organizational, communication,  team  trust,  and  cultural  issues  need  to  be  tackled  by  organizations  and  teams involved in distributed development.\\', \\'despite the recent growth of this topic, distributed software development is still evolving.\\', \\'as such, the failure rate of dse projects is higher than collocated projects [77].\\', \\'dse allows the client organization to engage in activities across one or more remote sites [77].\\', \\'the combination of remote sites forms a network of sub-teams or remote teams that work together on a common goal.\\', \\'when dsd is implemented using agile methodologies, such as scrum or xp, the  challenges  increase.\\', \\'for  instance,  the  coordination  of  tasks  between  teams  becomes  a  more challenging endeavor for project managers and leads [77].\\', \\'before dse and outsourcing gained momentum, organizations used to outsource work to a vendor that  performed  single  basic  functions.\\', \\'the  first  documented  outsourcing  was  in  1963  between electronic  data  systems  (eds)  and  bluecross  blue  shield  of  pennsylvania  where  eds  was responsible  for  managing  bluecross’  data  [79].\\', \\'following  the  success  of  this  initiative,  eds started to receive intake work from companies like frito-lay and general motors.\\', \\'this is when large-scale  outsourcing became  noticeable.\\', \\'in the late 1980s,  ibm signed a  deal  with kodak to outsource their technology initiatives [79].\\', \\'the commonality between these deals were that they were total outsourcing, where there is a transfer of the work, human resources and management, as opposed to a project, components of a project, or augmenting human resources.\\', \\'as  requirements  became  intense,  software  construction  became  more  complicated.\\', \\'to  make matters more complex, several companies were formed in the 1990s that had specific skills or had distribution rights on software [79].\\', \\'this forced companies who wished to integrate or purchase such  software  to  engage  in  deals  with  these  specialized  companies.\\', \\'this  resulted  in  companies such as kodak, general motors, ibm, and eds working with multiple vendors, which led to the introduction  of  dse  and  the  birth  of  several  fields,  such  as  contract  management,  customer relations,  auditing,  and  benchmarking  [79].\\', \\'although  gartner  group  reports  that  70%  of 2 ccompanies engage in some form of outsourcing, they estimate that a significant proportion of these companies will also have to renegotiate their contracts [78].\\', \\'agile  methodologies  are  undertaken  by  organizations  that  are  interested  in  delivering  business value  regularly  and  often  [85].\\', \\'additionally,  organizations  can  quickly  assess  the  value  of  the product  early  on  and  decide  on  the  fate  of  the  project  without  spending  too  much  money.\\', \\'the product owners focus on prioritizing the functionality, such that the core value of the project is delivered in the early releases; therefore, increasing value to the organization.\\', \\'as the market trend changes, the team can quickly adapt to the change.\\', \\'agile projects are known to decrease overall portfolio cost by cancelling projects and programs early on therefore emphasizing on those projects that have a good return on investment [14][23].\\', \\'the core practice of agile methodologies, such as xp, is that they prefer collocation of human resources,  less  documentation,  and  face-to-face  interaction  thereby  eliminating  communication related delays, and creating team cohesion [44].\\', \\'if the above is true, then xp projects can eliminate the need for extensive and formal requirements analysis and entire design of the system early on [49].\\', \\'in each iteration or sprint, the project team will analyze, design, develop, and test only the functionality  that  is  part  of  the  sprint.\\', \\'as  functionality  is  developed,  it  is  integrated  with  the previously  delivered  functionality  and  validated.\\', \\'at  the  end  of  the  sprint,  deployment  into production is scheduled resulting in quick feedback from the customers and other stakeholders.\\', \\'projects  that  engage  in  dse  are  bound  to  face  many  challenges  [14][23].\\', \\'even  with  these challenges, organizations wish to engage in dse due to cost savings (40%), capacity of remote teams (20%), application knowledge (13%), and quick time to market (11%) [66].\\', \\'[65] defines the characteristics of dse as the following: • • • • • • • multi-sourcing  –  multiple  distributed  member  involvement  in  a  joint  project; characterized by a number of collaboration partners.\\', \\'geographic distribution – partners are located far away from each other.\\', \\'temporal diversity – characterized by the level of working hours overlay.\\', \\'socio-cultural diversity – level of social, ethnic and, cultural fit.\\', \\'linguistic diversity – characterized by the level of language skills.\\', \\'contextual  diversity  – level  of  organizational fit  (diversity in  process  maturity and work practices).\\', \\'political  and  legislative  diversity  -  effect  of  cross  border  collaboration  due  to political threats or threats associated with incompatibility of laws.\\', \\'organizations that wish to engage in dse could find that agile methods provide the flexibility that  they  need  [31][83].\\', \\'however,  the  principles  of  dse  and  agile  are  not  always  necessarily compatible  [18].\\', \\'there  is  no  collocation  amongst  team  members  resulting  in  no  face-to-face interaction.\\', \\'team  cohesion  does  not  exist  due  to  cultural  and  language  issues.\\', \\'informal communication  is  also  not  certain  depending  on  the  time  zones  where  sub-teams  reside  which result  in  asynchronous  communication.\\', \\'projects  with  distributed  human  resources  could  require more documentation to avoid any issues around scope misunderstanding, which is not inline with agile characteristics [18].\\', \\'3 cin  addition,  xp  practices  such  as  pair  programming  are  difficult  to  implement  with  distributed human resources.\\', \\'agile revolves around informal practices and mutual adjustment where as dse revolves around formal mechanisms and direct supervision [84].\\', \\'based on the above, it seems that agile methods do not work with distributed software development projects.\\', \\'it cannot be the case that  agile practices be implemented partially as agile  insists that it  be  implemented entirely in order to be efficient [64].\\', \\'research of dse and agile related issues are ongoing and application of best practices is being piloted on several distributed projects.\\', \\'with  distributed  human  resources  and  agile  methodologies  becoming  more  common,  it  is important  to  get  a  good  understanding  of  the  challenges  faced  by  organizations  that  have implemented distributed agile software engineering (dase) in the past [76][80].\\', \\'the objective of this study is to provide an understanding of these challenges and propose solutions on ways to deal  with  these  challenges.\\', \\'results  of  this  study  will  help  organizations  engaging  in  dase  by providing  an  overview  of  the  distribution  model  used  in  past  studies,  challenges  faced,  and solutions implemented to deal with the challenges.\\', \\'this  paper  is  structured  as  follows.\\', \\'section  2  provides  a  background  discussion  covering  the rationale of this work, the research questions that this work intends to answer, followed by section 3 on an overview of related work.\\', \\'section 4 provides an overview of the design of this systematic literature review.\\', \\'section 5 discusses the  execution of the review  along with threats to validity.\\', \\'section 6 presents and discusses the results of the review in reference to the research questions outlined  in  section  2.\\', \\'section  7  highlights  and  discusses  the  main  findings  derived  from  the analysis of the results and provides a concluding discussion of the review and its findings followed by recommendations for future work.\\', \\'2.\\', \\'motivation and research questions systematic  reviews  are  becoming  a  standard  research  method  amongst  software  engineers  [68].\\', \\'since its inception in 2004, systematic literature reviews have gained significant popularity among software engineers [68].\\', \\'however, despite their gain in popularity, practitioners still are lacking in significant  knowledge  about  this  research  method  and  the  number  of  explored  topics  remains limited [68].\\', \\'the deficiency in explored topics holds true in the area of dase and justifies a need for  more  systematic  literature  reviews  of  agile  when  implemented  with  distributed  human resources.\\', \\'to our knowledge, there have only been very few systematic literature reviews performed in the specific area of agile methods for global and distributed software development/engineering.\\', \\'the paper by smite et al has focused on reviewing empirical evidence in global software engineering; therefore, it is not focused on aspects of agile methodologies [72].\\', \\'similarly, jimenez and piattini focus on some major problems within the distributed software development domain in general and provide an overview of some of the suggested solutions.\\', \\'the work by hossain et al is closer to the theme of our work and focuses on the review of the role and impact of the scrum approach on 4 cdistributed software development.\\', \\'however, it is only restricted to scrum from the range of agile methodologies.\\', \\'the works by jalali and wohlin [71][73] are the closest to our work in this paper as they have attempted to summarize the state of the art in agile practices within global software engineering until 2010 and investigate which of the agile practices have been effectively used in global  software  engineering.\\', \\'while  the  topic  area  of  the  work  in  these two  papers  is  similar  to ours, we differ in the objectives of our systematic literature reviews.\\', \\'while  the  work  by  jalali  and  wohlin  [71][73]  focus  on  summarizing  the  state  of  the  art  and identifying the important circumstances for deploying successful agile methods for global software engineering, we focus on more  fundamental research questions.\\', \\'the objectives of our work are multifold.\\', \\'first,  we  would  like  to  understand  the  reasons  and  conditions  that  lead  towards  the adoption of distributed agile software engineering practices.\\', \\'second, we would like to investigate and  find  out  the  most  important  risks  that  can  threaten  a  distributed  agile  software  engineering approach  and  what  mitigation  strategies  exist  to  address  them.\\', \\'finally,  would  like  to  highlight which of the available approaches among the existing agile methodologies have been successfully adopted  by  the  community.\\', \\'we  intend  to  solidify  our  findings  by  exploring  the  strength  of  the evidence that has been reported in the literature.\\', \\'as we will later explain in section 4.2, a major differentiating factor for our work compared to the earlier work by jalali and wohlin is that our focus has been to include only the work that have a strong empirical, experimental, or case study perspective.\\', \\'for  this  reason,  our  search  query  has  been  designed  in  such  a  way  to  include publications in dase that have the empirical investigatory aspect to them.\\', \\'this is something that has not been the focus for jalali and wohlin.\\', \\'we translate our research objectives into four specific research questions as follows: ●  rq1: what are the conditions under which organizations choose to adopt dase?\\', \\'this question will help future engagers in dase by providing a holistic picture of the circumstances that have led prior researchers and/or practitioners to adopt dase.\\', \\'●  rq2: what are the biggest threats when adopting dase?\\', \\'this question will help those who wish to engage in dase by outlining documented risks and the impact they can have on the successful delivery of dase.\\', \\'●  rq3: what model of agile is most adopted in dase?\\', \\'this question will help adopters understand which of the existing agile methodologies have had a higher success history and there is evidence from the community to show their impact.\\', \\'●  rq4: what is the strength of evidence in supporting the findings of the above questions?\\', \\'this question will clarify the degree of strength of evidence that are available within the literature to support the findings in this systematic literature review.\\', \\'in order to provide proper levels of details for abovementioned research questions, these questions are refined into several research questions.\\', \\'all research questions and their descriptions are recorded in table 1.\\', \\'5 cit is important to point out that the supporting evidence to study each of these research questions is based on the information that has been reported by the community in the form of peer-reviewed publications in conferences or journals as explained later.\\', \\'therefore, the research questions should be understood in that context and note should be taken when interpreting the results, as there may be work in actual practice that has not been reported in the literature and so has not been captured in our work.\\', \\'in light of this, the research questions should be read as, for instance, what are the conditions under which organizations choose to adopt dase as indicated in the reported

of this paper was to understand the state of the art in gse and to get a feel of the strength of the empirical evidence reflected in the literature.\\', \\'there were 59 papers published since 2000

case studies based on interviews in a controlled environment with students.\\', \\'the review indicated that although such research had been done for a few years and outsourcing had been practiced for up to 20 years, there was no single recipe for success.\\', \\'the outsourcing field in still relatively new and, as  such,  there  is  a  lack  of  methods,  techniques,  and  tools  in  an

procedures,  and  strategies  brought  more  success  in gse/dse.\\', \\'examples  of processes,  procedures,  and  strategies  included  cmm,  cmmi,  cobit, and itil.\\', \\'an interesting point of this paper is that it discussed how procedures could impact dse –  as  organizations  could  conduct  outsourcing  with  companies  that  might  have  different  cmm levels or could follow different frameworks (itil vs.\\', \\'prince).\\', \\'a total of 69 papers published between 2000 and 2007 were selected as part of this research.\\', \\'a majority of the 69 papers were published in 2007

community.\\', \\'however, in our work we provided a different perspective on the literature, i.e., we first  explore the  underlying reasons  why agile methodologies are  adopted  within dsd.\\', \\'in other words, we explore the roots and grounds for which agile methodologies were adopted.\\', \\'this allows for a deeper understanding of the evolution practices within dase.\\', \\'furthermore, we identify the major  roadblocks  and  risks  that  hinder  and  threaten  the  successful  adoption  of  dase.\\', \\'in  our opinion,  this  is  a  significant  distinguishing  factor  for  our  work  as  it  enables  practitioners  to understand the prospects of adopting dase.\\', \\'finally, we highlight the agile approaches that have been widely used in dase and further

properties: rq 1.1 aims to bring forth the sdlc phase involved in distributed agile software engineering.\\', \\'this  was  answered  by  understanding  the  context  of  the  study  (property  1.1,  1.2),  by  analyzing reasons  why  this  particular  study  engaged  in  dase  (property  2.1),  the  impacts  of  dase engagement (property 1.3), and sdlc phase more active in dase (property

provided  will prevent threats to validity of the results of this review.\\', \\'in some cases, published papers that are part  of  this  paper’s  review  could  be  written  poorly,  have  ambiguous

\\'in  this  paper,  the  option to make general  impressions on subjective evidence was used.\\', \\'again, in this circumstance, the extracted information was verified by all the authors.\\', \\'no disagreements in the extracted data or classification were reported back.\\', \\'in  order  to  avoid  data  extraction  bias,  it  is  recommended  by  [68]  that  two  or  more  researchers should perform data extraction independently.\\', \\'data from the researchers must be compared and disagreements  resolved  either  by  consensus  among  researchers  or  arbitration  by  an  additional

\\'our major finding is that projects that engage in dase decide to roll it out throughout all of the sdlc phases.\\', \\'this is an expected finding given the iterative and rapid nature of agile practices, as it would be rather difficult if not impossible to deploy an agile strategy in one of the sdlc phases in isolation.\\', \\'the papers not classified under “all phases” in table 8 are those that explicitly mention that they have only contributed to one of the  listed  sdlc  phases  in  table  8;  therefore,  table  8  lists  the  sdlc  phases  as  their  were mentioned  in  those

biggest risks in dase (rq 2.1)?\\', \\'this question aims at documenting risks that projects have faced and issues that have risen during the course of the project.\\', \\'communication in  communication,  time  zone  differences,  lack  of  synchronous  communication,  language differences,  infrastructure  (e.g.,  video  conferencing  or  tools),  and  lack  of  visibility  on  priority, requirements, demo, and sprint reviews were considered the big risks in dase.\\', \\'time  zone  differences  caused  major  challenges  when  it  came  to  arranging  meetings,  especially longer meetings as it related to sprint planning [1][55].\\', \\'in cases where time difference was more than 5 hours, human resources had to arrange a common time for meetings (usually late or early hours).\\', \\'additionally, due to time zone difference, communication was mostly indirect via email and via comments in a software system, if available [3][8][60].\\', \\'telephone was considered a good choice, but was found effective only if both parties knew each other already.\\', \\'since team members do  not  have  a  chance  to  get  to  know  each  other  personally,  people  hesitated  to  initiate  direct contact and preferred to communicate indirectly [24].\\', \\'this led to a single-point-of-communication way of information exchange: the project leaders [24].\\', \\'teleconferencing was utilized in some meetings, but was listed as being exhaustive due to sound quality, difficulty in recognizing speaker’s voice, and language differences [1][37][53][61][62].\\', \\'in some cases, the network connections between offices were not fast enough for videoconferencing or offices did not have video conferencing capabilities [46].\\', \\'although in most cases, team members spoke a common language (albeit not the first language for the  involved  parties),  it  was  noted  that  speaking  style  contributed  to  language  issues.\\', \\'as  an example, some team members can be loud and direct while other team members can be careful and cautious in their expression [27] [33] [39].\\', \\'since  most  communications  were  conducted  by  phone  and  (in some  cases)  video  conferencing, considerable  time  was  spent  in  projects  clarifying  items  being  discussed,  because  much  of  the meaning, tone and emotion were lost through this communication medium [2][37][39].\\', \\'as such, participants did not get a clear understanding of the requirements and priority.\\', \\'in some cases, the facilitator lacked enough experienced  to understand if the team had understood the requirements correctly and that the right priority is assigned to this activity [4][7][11][17][34][57][59][62].\\', \\'when it comes to reviewing demo and sprints with all teams involved, software were not always used to demonstrate sprint reviews.\\', \\'this is because not all organizations had an infrastructure set up.\\', \\'a  technically  savvy  product  owner  made  an  effort  to  take  screenshots  and  videos  of  the product to share with the team, but distributed team members found it hard to follow  [8][53].\\', \\'23 ccollaboration in  collaboration,  availability  of  the  scrum  master,  human  resource  knowledge,  inexperience, transparency,  human resource coaching, mentoring, motivation, trust,  productivity, lack of team structure,  improper  work  distribution,  and  lack  of  strategic  solutions  were  listed  as  some challenges.\\', \\'one of the concerns under collaboration was that scrum masters did not facilitate scrum reviews [8].\\', \\'this led to delays and absence of working software to demonstrate.\\', \\'additionally, with the lack of video conferencing, team members did not have visibility as to who is the scrum master in the tool.\\', \\'with inexperience in agile methods, projects missed a strong leadership from scrum masters during  negotiations  with  business  partners  who  flooded  team  members  with  a  long  list  of  last minute  changes  by  the  end  of  each  sprint.\\', \\'project  management  maturity  on  agile  practices impacted development life cycle [8].\\', \\'it was noted that on some projects team members lacked knowledge of agile methods.\\', \\'this was most  noted  when  it  came  to  scrum  masters  not  having  the  knowledge  to  drive  their  team [9][10][16][28][34].\\', \\'additionally,  clients  that  did  not  have  previous  experience  with  agile methods relied on the project manager who tried to work with the client as a meta scrum master / coach to bring the organization into an agile way of working and acted as proxy product owner.\\', \\'this resulted in more issues in cases where the representative was not experienced enough with domain  knowledge  to  interpret  customers’  needs  and  devise  better  solutions  [34].\\', \\'teams  that worked with a remote scrum master and/or product owner were impacted on days when there was misunderstanding in scope [51].\\', \\'another  area  that  becomes  challenging  in  dase  is  coaching.\\', \\'when  projects  are  close  to  a catastrophe, the coaches come into the picture.\\', \\'when coaches are remote, coaching is not very effective [19][45].\\', \\'the biggest problems in the project involved multiple sites are lacking and poor functioning processes and the lack of collaboration between the sites.\\', \\'thus, solving these problems by  coaching  only  one  site  is  impossible.\\', \\'to  cover  the  gap  of  a  missing  local  mentor,  other managers took over the local mentor role, which did not help [52].\\', \\'lack of team structure and roles and responsibility is another challenge in dase [9][45][55].\\', \\'this  happens,  more  frequently,  when  team  members  lack  experience.\\', \\'agile  practices  state  that every team member must collaborate as a generalist in project tasks [9].\\', \\'this only works if there is information flow between teams.\\', \\'it was noted that customer organizations were reluctant to openly share  information  with  the  contractor  or  vendor  organizations,  even  though  they  were implementing  the  same  system  [45][53].\\', \\'the  detached  nature  of  the  customer  and  its representatives  manifested  itself  especially  when  requirements  that  the  remote  team  was accountable for were discussed [48].\\', \\'trust and lack of productivity is another challenge.\\', \\'during project implementation, trust needs to be established and maintained; otherwise, remote team members will not be able to get along with 24 ceach other [35][47][59].\\', \\'it is difficult to foster team bonding and collaboration with the distributed teams with few or no face-to-face interaction.\\', \\'work distribution with distributed human resources is another challenge.\\', \\'distribution of work is not  easily  done  with  distributed  human  resources.\\', \\'this  is  because  dependencies  required collaboration  between  team  members  that  are  working  toward  implementing  the  same  stories [10][16][23][31][40][56].\\', \\'additionally,  some  work  cannot  be  distributed  due  to  remote  access challenges.\\', \\'at such times, the scrum master, project manager, and leads should be capable of foreseeing such dependencies and dividing work when possible.\\', \\'sometimes, due to time pressure, user  stories  from  a  single  feature  are  often  distributed  and  are  implemented  by  multiple  teams [15][32][37].\\', \\'this  in  turns  increases  the  amount  of  collaboration.\\', \\'if  processes  are  set  up,  then unique responsibilities should be assigned.\\', \\'another challenge noted was the team missing the big picture and making tactical decisions.\\', \\'agile teams do focus more on tactical rather than strategic decisions [42][62].\\', \\'the reason why is that working in time-boxed iterations gave teams a short-term focus, usually of 2–4 weeks in duration.\\', \"as such, teams lost sight of the organization\\\\\\\\\\'s goals for customer delivery and how their decisions helped reach those goals.\", \\'coordination under  coordination,  lack  of  documentation,  cost  for  synchronous  communication,  shared components, sharing of proprietary or sensitive data, and lack of process were considered as major challenges.\\', \\'agile, unlike waterfall, does not focus of full documentation of requirements or product and sprint backlog  [37].\\', \\'as  such,  teams  were,  at  times  unclear  on  the  requirements  that  needed  to  be implemented.\\', \\'requirements  were  gathered  on  exhaustive  meetings  (8  hours  duration)  and documented in minutes [9][18].\\', \\'index cards were posted on walls at the office were requirement reviews were held and not always replicated manually at the other sites [25][51].\\', \\'story cards from one  site  are  not  directly  shown  to  the  distributed  teams,  and  key  behaviors,  such  as  modifying index cards are difficult to share with remote colleagues.\\', \\'cost  of  synchronous  communication  is  another  challenge  under  coordination.\\', \\'due  to  time  zone differences, teams had to arrange a common time for meetings [29].\\', \\'this common time usually was early or late during the date, resulting in the team member working outside of regular working hours.\\', \\'this resulted in cost increase as there was a change in working hours.\\', \\'having common or shared components was listed as another challenge as it makes coordination difficult.\\', \\'the solution  architect  designs  systems  based  on  organizational  architectural  direction and  industry  standards.\\', \\'such  design  could,  at  times,  have  dependencies  between  components [7][42][53].\\', \\'this  leads  to  increased  dependencies  among  products  and  components  –  with componentization being weak and code reuse being highly valued [42].\\', \\'25 cwhen dealing with very sensitive customer data, it was difficult for teams to pass data for testing or defect analysis [20].\\', \\'while customers were willing to share those data with the primary team for the limited use in testing the software under development, the agreements generally did not extend to offshore partners [20][40].\\', \\'this limited some of what the vendor organizations could develop and test.\\', \\'while processes were enforced  on the primary organization, in  dispersed teams it is even more important to have supportive processes defined than in organizations that work in one location.\\', \\'it was deemed crucial for project managers to clearly define artifacts to be developed and to assign unique  responsibilities  [8][24][30][36].\\', \\'this  caused  confusion  within teams  as  vendor organizations were not used to the processes enforced by customers.\\', \\'cultural differences work  practices,  regional  holidays,  ways  of  speaking,  hierarchical,  and  importance  to  project timelines were challenges under cultural differences.\\', \\'work  pattern  of  human  resources  vary  depending  on  where  collaborating  parties  reside.\\', \\'for example, indian developers remained mostly silent at the daily meetings and are instead engaged in  forced  communication  by  the  scrum  master  [39].\\', \\'additionally,  it  was  noted  that  human resources in some countries required work to be assigned to them as opposed to human resources suggesting what work they would like to be involved in [61].\\', \\'this led to uncritical or sometimes boring tasks assigned to offshore teams.\\', \\'regional holidays result in a team of human resources being unavailable for project work.\\', \\'if the project manager is unaware of such holidays while planning, this could result in deviations from the schedule [5].\\', \\'language and practice are another area where cultural challenges apply.\\', \\'while communicating, it is  noted  that  some  cultures  speak  load  and  direct  while  some  cultures  are  careful  and  cautions [7][11].\\', \\'additionally,  some  speak  fast  while  some  speak  slowly.\\', \\'in  some  cultures,  it  is  not acceptable to say no to family superiors – even if what is being said is wrong.\\', \\'all of these lead to gaps that are difficult to manage if team members are not aware of [47].\\', \\'another  cultural  problem,  especially  with  the  daily  scrum  meeting,  was  the  notion  that  human resources  were  “reporting  to  scrum  master”  instead  of  synchronizing  knowledge  between colleagues  [13].\\', \\'this  creates  a  false  sense  of  hierarchy  that  some  human  resources  are  used  to having – similar to having work assigned.\\', \\'in  regards  to  project  timeline  and  milestones,  some  cultures  consider  the  project  schedule  as guidelines as opposed to commitment.\\', \\'this results in

[29][51][53].\\', \\'wiki was found to be one of the most useful communication channels in the implementation phase of the project largely due to the distributed nature of the effort [45][51][57].\\', \\'wiki-based agile planning tools can also be utilized to publish, manage,  integrate  and  distribute  agile planning information  [51].\\', \\'the  advantage  of using wiki-based  systems  is  that

communication media to be used during their execution [2][3][18][53][59][61].\\', \\'an example of communication activities is an xp project that is undergoing the planning game or daily stand-up meetings [49].\\', \\'the goal of a planning game is to get prioritized requirements from the customer [18][28][49].\\', \\'the goal of a stand-up  meeting  is  to  get  everybody  in  the  team  up  to  date  on  the  current  status  including information  about  problems  and  solutions.\\', \\'each  communication  activity  has  different  needs  for communication media (e.g.,: livemeeting, video conferencing, and wiki) that facilitates it.\\', \\'ambassadors (or coaches or a governance body) are dedicated human resources with the task to bridge between remote teams.\\', \\'it was suggested that ambassadors should concentrate especially on facilitation  of  communication  between the  sites by helping  in  solving  problems  and finding the 29 cright persons to answer questions coming from the customer [5][11][13][17][18][29][34][52][58].\\', \\'additionally,  such  resource  can  also  help  resolve  misunderstanding  and  help  in  language difficulties by communicating in the language that the customer understands.\\', \\'one of the best ways to improve trust and help collaboration would be to collocate.\\', \\'since this is not feasible when working with distributed resources, it was recommended to have teams meet at times during the project [11][19][31][44][53].\\', \\'there were two types of face-to-face meetings used – seed visits and maintenance visits.\\', \\'seed visits were visits where teams (or some team members) collocated for the initial iteration/sprints of the project.\\', \\'maintenance visits were visits where teams (or some team members) collocated for brief periods throughout the course of the project.\\', \\'both types of  collocation strategies helped increase team comfort and helped  establish trust.\\', \\'in  some cases, organizations tried to utilize conferences where team members could meet.\\', \\'cultural differences there are ways in which cultural differences could be dealt with.\\', \\'by following up on questions to ensure team members have understood and by interviewing resources prior to engaging them on projects are two ways in which risks could be mitigated.\\', \\'to  avoid  miscommunications  or  misunderstanding  of  requirements  in  the  dase  process, numerous feedback loops were put in place in numerous projects [2][28].\\', \\'in essence, remote team members used the daily scrum meeting to update the team on what was completed on the previous day and what was planned to be completed.\\', \\'this raised the customer’s confidence that the team have  understood  the  scope  correctly  [11][25][33][34][48].\\', \\'additionally,  the  customer  (or  a representative) or the business analyst would ask follow up questions to ensure that the team has a solid grasp on the requirements.\\', \\'it  was  noted  in  some  projects  that  resources  were  unfit  to  perform  assigned  activities.\\', \\'in  some countries available talent base is large but the true skill set of a given individual often varies from the  picture  presented  by  their  resume  [36].\\', \\'papers  suggest  that  a  rigorous  recruitment  process should pay attention to both technical competence and cultural fit [36].\\', \\'collaboration there  are  a  number  of  proposed  solutions  in  place  to  deal  with  collaboration  related  risks  – overlap work timings, monitor work progress,  review lessons  learned,  planning around regional holidays, training resources, keeping some work local, utilizing tools, daily builds, shorter sprints, decentralizing  decision  making,  documentation,  smaller  teams  (or  teams  per  story),  creating  a modularized architecture, and using a scrum-of-scrum model.\\', \\'overlapping work timings is an easy way to have formal and informal communication.\\', \\'in some cases, such as those with greater than 7 hour time zone difference, overlapping work timings will be very expensive and not feasible [3][7][19][27][33][39][53].\\', \\'having the team overlap timings by having  resources  come  in  very  early  or  stay  late  will  be  bad  for  morale  and  expensive  for  the project (if overtime is paid).\\', \\'in cases where time zone is less than 7 hours, it is possible to have 30 csome  team  member  start  work  early  on  one  site  and  late  on  the  other.\\', \\'this  allows  for  team members engage in synchronously communication [19][35][51][53].\\', \\'monitoring work is another way of dealing with issues.\\', \\'iteration/sprint review sessions and daily scrum

expectations.\\', \\'reviewing  lessons  learned  from  past  dase  projects  and  previous  sprints  can  also  be  useful  to improve on mistakes made in the past.\\', \\'it was recommended to

to the quality of work in future sprints.\\', \\'although  planning  around  regional  holidays  is  not  a  major  item,  it  is  important  to  note  that  if regional holidays were not incorporated in the project schedule, there would be delays to the sprint [5][46].\\', \\'additionally, if a regional holiday falls on a demo or sprint planning day, then the scrum master and/or project manager will have to coordinate with other teams to find a suitable day to perform those activities.\\', \\'resources  could  be  inexperienced  in  their  activities  or  in  the  dase  process.\\', \\'in  either  case, resources need to undergo training, mentoring, or coaching.\\', \\'it was highly recommended that if the scrum master was inexperienced, then the project team should replace the scrum master with a more  experienced  resource  [5][11][22][34][36][44][57].\\', \\'projects  that  miss  a  strong  leadership from the scrum master end up being flooded with last minute change requests from the business partners.\\', \\'it was also  recommended to  have employees undergo a one-week training course  that explains agile, distributed team structure, and processes [11][36][44].\\', \\'while most development work can be distributed, there is project work that is not easily done in a distributed way.\\', \\'it is recommended to keep such work within a team.\\', \\'some examples of suitable candidates to keep local would be proprietary work, work that cannot be done due to remote access restrictions, testing using data that cannot be shared with unauthorized team members, or work that is considered complex [20][42][58].\\', \\'tools, if used correctly, can ease project coordination.\\', \\'this is especially true in dase [7][11][46].\\', \\'tools can be used to document and easily perform activities such as share requirements, design, development, test cases, data, and infrastructure details.\\', \\'in addition, there are tools such as wiki, whiteboard,  sharepoint,  and  scrumworks  (for  backlogs)  that  can  be  used  to  provide  team members  a  digital  forum  using  which  they  can  fill  the  gaps  introduced  by  having  distributed resources [7][11][46].\\', \\'daily builds  are  another  way  of  improving  the  dase  experience.\\', \\'releasing  as  many  builds  as possible, a project team can eliminate wastes in terms of waiting for a whole package to be tested [58].\\', \\'every  sprint  delivered  not  only  increased  team  motivation  but  also  improved  collaboration  and engagement.\\', \\'as such, it was recommended to have shorter sprints where something tangible is 31 cmade  available  to  the  customer  [23][56].\\', \\'it  was  also  noted  that  overall  quality,  interaction, cooperation, and experience improves with every sprints.\\', \\'applying short iterations, frequent builds and continuous integration in the development process leads to feedback.\\', \\'this feedback motivates developers and motivates developers to feel more like a team.\\', \\'a shorter development cycle can also  be  used  to  reduce  risks  and  increase  feedback  for  other  teams  [20][22][23][44][46][53].\\', \\'if iteration time is shorter, more communication is needed to make sure next priorities in a product are being prioritized correctly.\\', \\'decentralizing decision-making is  another  way  of  improving  the  dase  experience.\\', \\'because of this aspect, both geographical and temporal distances become less of an issue since developers can take  certain  decisions  without  having  to  confer  with  management,  which  could  be  located  in another part of the world [12][20][41][49].\\', \\'additionally, the idea of applying semi-self-organized teams serves as a motivational goal [20][41].\\', \\'working with agile methods with distributed resources requires formal documentation.\\', \\'business should focus on artifact creation especially documentation from the product team.\\', \\'it was noted that by creating documentation, teams did not communicate as much, which worked to the benefit of the  project  since  communication  is  considered  a  challenge  when  working  with  distributed resources [9][24][27][37][49].\\', \\'any documentation that would decrease communication issues in an agile method should be part of the process.\\', \\'having teams set up such that one (collocated) team works on a story together was considered best practice [31].\\', \\'doing so decreases communication and dependencies between distributed teams.\\', \\'architecture-centric software engineering focuses on minimizing the inefficiencies associated with traditional process-centric development.\\', \\'the approach adopts a set of principles that are different and often initially uncomfortable in corporate contexts [21][32].\\', \\'the key enabler for architecture-centric software engineering is to minimize dependencies between components.\\', \\'although this is central to architecture design, architects often de-prioritize decoupling to achieve other attributes.\\', \\'architecture-centric  software  engineering  removes  so  many  inefficiencies  from  the  software development process that the output of the organization is much higher [32].\\', \\'table  17  summarizes  workaround  and  mitigation  plans  documented  in  published  literature.\\', \\'workaround and mitigation plans are sorted by times reported.\\', \\'now given the risks and mitigation plans have been covered across all of the selected studies in tables  16  and  17,  it  is  interesting  to  point  out  what  were  the  most  challenging  risks  and  the associated mitigation plans that were recommended based on the degree of experience the team members had.\\', \\'team members’ experience with dase has already been reported in table 12.\\', \\'we look at the three classes of experience defined in this table (yes: experienced with dase, no: not experienced with dase, and some resources: some team members had experience) and report the top three risks and mitigation plans that were reported in each class.\\', \\'in those studies where the team members were deemed to be experienced, the top three risks were as  follows:  1)  communication  –  infrastructure,  2)  collaboration  –  inexperience,  and  3) 32 ccommunication – synchronous.\\', \\'it seems that in such teams the most challenging risks pertain to logistics  of  procuring  the  right  infrastructure  for  communicating  in  a  distributed  environment (communication infrastructure and synchronousness).\\', \\'collaboration – inexperience referred to the effort  required  to  train  inexperienced  human  resources.\\', \\'in  terms  of  mitigation  strategies  1) communication  –  infrastructure,  2)  collaboration  –  tools,  and  3)  communication  – communication strategy were deemed most important, which again reflects the need to effectively address the communication logistics within a distributed environment.\\', \\'for  the  studies  where  the  team  members  had  no  experience  with  dase,  the  three  top  risks included:  1)  communication  –  time  zone,  2)  collaboration  –  team  structure  /  roles  and responsibilities, and 3) communication – synchronous.\\', \\'it seems that teams with no experience in dase struggle with synchronization issues such as time zone differences and the need to work under  different  conditions  in  a  distributed  asynchronous  environment.\\', \\'in  order  to  mitigate  the issues, these papers reported 1) communication – face-to-face visits, 2) collaboration – overlap work timings, and 3) communication – encourage formal and informal communication as the mitigation  strategies.\\', \\'these  mitigation  strategies  mostly  try  to  address  the  need  to  effectively communicate under asynchronous conditions.\\', \\'finally, in the third class where some of the human resources had experience in dase, the types of  reported  risks  were  similar  to  the  risks  reported  in  the  class  with  no  experience:  1) communication  –  time  zone,  2)  communication  –  priority,  and  3)  communication  – synchronous.\\', \\'the mitigation strategies consisted of 1) communication – face-to-face visits, 2) communication  –  encourage  formal  and  informal  communication,  and  3)  collaboration  – documentation.\\', \\'analogous to when team members did not have experience the focus here is on issues of synchronization.\\', \\'in brief, based on the literature, it seems that teams with more experience in dase have concerns regarding  logistics  of  communication  and  try  to  overcome  this  through  infrastructure  support, while  less  experienced  teams  face  issues  of  effective  collaboration  and  synchronization  and therefore, employ mitigation strategies such as face-to-face meetings to overcome them.\\', \\'  6.3.\\', \\'what model of the agile methodology

projects (3% of total) were somewhat successful in a sense that the projects were complete, but with variation to scope, time, or budget.\\', \\'an interesting observation that we would like to report on is the relationship between the risks and mitigation strategies that were reported in tables 16 and 17 and the agile method that was reported in the papers.\\', \\'in other words, we were interested to see whether the agile method that was used as a part of each paper had any relationship with certain types of risks or not.\\', \\'our finding was that besides pair programming, scrumup and lean development, which have less than 2 papers each and  therefore  the  evidence  is  not  conclusive,  the  other  4  methods  mentioned  in  the  literature typically had the same frequency in reporting the set of risks and mitigation strategies as shown in tables 16 and 17.\\', \\'in other words, we could not see a trend where a majority of the papers related to a specific agile method were related to certain risks.\\', \\'one possible explanation for this could be that  the  risks  and  the  mitigation  strategies  that  were  reported  were  mainly  focused  on  the distributed aspect of dase as opposed to the agile method that was used.\\', \\'agile model used scrum agile, specifics not mentionedscrum and xp xp pair programming scrumup (custom) lean development and

reason  for  such  results  is  that  maybe  the  community  is inclined towards the publication of only successful project reports; therefore, papers included in this study only contained successful report and no failure reports were observed.\\', \\'it should however be  noted  that  that  26  out  of  63  papers  (41%)  did  not  explicitly  indicate  if  their  project  was  a success or failure.\\', \\'it was noted that 44% of scrum projects, 63% of general agile, and 44% of xp projects did not explicitly report success.\\', \\'of the remaining tailored methodologies, 33% of scrum and xp hybrid did  not  explicitly  report  success  while  scrumup  and  lean  and  scrum  tailed  models  had  not reported failure.\\', \\'based on this observation, it is difficult to make a definitive conclusion regarding the  more  effective  and  less  effective  models.\\', \\'however,  based  on  the  available  data,  it  can inconclusively be said that tailored methodologies have a higher rate of success.\\', \\'it should be noted given the fact that these methodologies are specifically tailored and reported that they may suffer from  reporting  biases  as  well.\\', \\'we  highlight  in  the  future  works  section  of  this  paper  that  we recommend  that  better  and  more  substantial  reporting  rigor  be  used  in  the  future  to  report  on success  and  failure

research.\\', \\'however, 35% of papers evaluate a method, practice, framework, or tool while 65% captured risks and/or mitigations.\\', \\'to further breakdown, 25% of the papers evaluated a practice, tool, framework, or method in an industry setting.\\', \\'since the goal of this paper was not to capture best practices in dase, lower coverage of practices, tools, methods, and frameworks does not lower the degree of realism of this study.\\', \\'7.\\', \\'recommendations based on our observations of the reviewed publications in the area of distributed agile software engineering, we find that although a wealth of strong evidence is already provided for dase, there are  still  a  number  of  issues  that  needs  to  be  addressed  by  practitioners  and  researchers  when reporting on their experience with dase.\\', \\'covering these aspects when reporting on experience 37 cwith  dase  would  enable  the  community  to  draw  stronger  and  deeper  conclusions  about  the success or failure of projects adopting dase.\\', \\'we believe addressing the following issues when reporting experience could significantly help improve the current state of the art in dase: ●  documenting success and failure: when it comes to documenting success and failure in dase  projects,  it  was  noted  that  none  of  the  63  papers  had  reported  failure  in  their project.\\', \\'more importantly, 16 papers did not report either success or failure.\\', \\'in order to understand which model has a higher success ratio, researchers need to document exactly which model was used and whether their project was a success or not.\\', \\'by documenting failed  projects,  analysis  could  be  done  on  the  issues  faced  and  any  failed  mitigation strategies  followed  to  overcome  challenges.\\', \\'failure  can  also  be  seen  as  cases  where deviation  happened  for  various  reasons  from  the  initial  set  out  plan.\\', \\'for  instance, researchers  and  practitioners  can  report  on  whether  their  approach  met  its  expected objectives as initially set out or not.\\', \\'if deviations or alterations had to be made, what were those  and  to  what  extent  did  that  change  the  initial  plans.\\', \\'additionally,  it  helps understand the variables that directly affect success or failure (in both senses) – such as cmmi  level,  infrastructure,  resource  models,  and  experience.\\', \\'it  seems  that  the  current literature is now more inclined  towards reporting success  in the deployment of dase.\\', \\'while this is very beneficial, reporting on failure can also provide deep insight as to what needs to be considered or avoided when planning for dase.\\', \\'●  criteria for success and their measurement: although 35 papers had reported that they were  successful,  criteria  of  success  were  not  defined  in  most  of  these  papers.\\', \\'success criteria vary between organizations - budget, quality, and time to market.\\', \\'since none of the  papers  had  explicitly  reported  a  failed  project,  it  could  be  assumed  that  projects engaging  in  dase  have  achieved  cost  and  time  to  market  benefits.\\', \\'additionally,  as mentioned above, organizational processes and resource models also have an impact on success.\\', \\'therefore, it is important that reports on the success of dase include the criteria for determining the success of the project.\\', \\'in other words, what were the criteria that were used to determine that the project was a success.\\', \\'in addition to the criteria, unambiguous and repeatable measurement mechanisms need to be reported so that similar studies could be replicated later for the sake of comparison.\\', \\'●  experience of human resources: 37% of papers did not report on the level of experience of human resources in dase, 33% of papers did not report on the level of experience working  with  distributed  resources,  and  35%  of  papers  did  not  report  on  the  level  of experience working with agile methods.\\', \\'it is safe to assume that past experience working with a model helps bring success to future projects.\\', \\'for this reason, it would be beneficial if  the  experience  of  the  subjects  involved  in  the  experiments  or  actual  deployment scenario  is  also  reported.\\', \\'there  may  be  situation  when  the  dase  adoption  strategy  is strong but the  project  fails  as  a  result inexperienced human  resources.\\', \\'the  community would  need  to  be  able  to  distinguish  between  the  reasons  that  pertain  specifically  to 38 cdase  adoption  and secondary  factors  such  as  experience  of  human  resources  in  work under dase conditions.\\', \\'●  peak time zone difference: 40% of the papers did not report any information about the peak  time  zone  difference  between  distributed  teams.\\', \\'understanding  time  difference between  teams  is  important  given  the  fact  that  our  review  showed  that  synchronous communication is among the best workarounds when dealing with communication issues (12%) closely followed by formal and informal communication (10%) and overlapping work  timings  between  teams  (5%).\\', \\'therefore,  peak  time  zone  difference  can  have significant impact on the success of dase.\\', \\'for instance, two projects adopting exactly the same form of dase but only with a different peak time zone in their teams can end up  with  different  success  or  failure  stories.\\', \\'this  highlights  the  importance  of  carefully reporting peak time zone differences in the dase setting.\\', \\'●  collocation of teams: collocation helps build trust and improves working relationship as the  project  progresses.\\', \\'collocation  was  deemed  as  the  second  best  workaround  when dealing with challenges (10%).\\', \\'while collocation of teams shows impact on the success of dase, not all reports included specific information on how collocation was achieved in  their  work.\\', \\'from  among  the  reports  that  did  mention  whether  collocation  was  used during the project, many did not report on the type of collocation model that was used (seed  visits,  maintaining  visits,  or  both).\\', \\'it  would  be  important  to  understand  whether dase  projects  engaged  in  collocation  and  what  types  of  collocation  in  order  to  draw valid conclusion regarding their impact on the success or failure of dase.\\', \\'for instance, this  information  could  assist  in  answering  questions  such  as  whether  seed  visits  are enough to build trust and relationships or not.\\', \\'we would like to point out that not all of these specified data are pertinent or relevant to all studies in  dase;  therefore, reports need to only  cover the above aspects as much as they  relate to the objectives of their study.\\', \\' 8.\\', \\'direction for future work based on the review conducted, future work could be conducted on the following topics: 1.\\', \\'in our study, it was noted that there needed to be more tracking of success and failure of dase  projects.\\', \\'some  of  the  variables  that  could  directly  affect  success  of  a  dase project include:  a.\\', \\'agile  method:  agile  methods  have  variations  in  the  way  human  resources collaborate.\\', \\'as  an  example,  pair  programming  requires  human  resources  to share  a  desktop  during the  development  and  unit-testing  phases.\\', \\'pair programming can be done with distributed human resources using collaboration tools.\\', \\'39 cb.\\', \\'success  and  failure  criteria:  success  and failure  criteria vary  between projects and organizations.\\', \\'documenting and understanding criteria that define a projects success is important as it can help understand the overall success rate between agile methods.\\', \\'c.\\', \\'experience of human resources in agile and working with distributed resources: past  experience  working  with  agile  methods  and  working  with  distributed resources can improve chances of success on future dase initiatives.\\', \\'d.\\', \\'collocation strategy: agile methods prefer more collocated collaborations.\\', \\'since such is not feasible with distributed human resources, the human resources try to maintain seed visits and/or regular visits over the course of the project.\\', \\'e.\\', \\'time-zone  difference:  time-zone  differences  can  make  a  difference  between teams  communicating  synchronously  or  not.\\', \\'time  difference  of  more  than  5 hours could increase coordination and communication challenges.\\', \\'by using these variables to perform a survey within current organizations that engage in dase, practitioners could get a better understanding of what needs to be done prior to engaging in dase.\\', \\'2.\\', \\'frameworks, practices, tools, and methods tend to incorporate the best of each category in  order  to  assist  projects.\\', \\'in  our  study,  it  was  noted  that  21%  had  experimented  on  a practice,  9% using tools,  3%  using  methods,  and 2% using frameworks.\\', \\'it  was  clearly evident based on this review that agile methods need to be tailored when working with distributed resources.\\', \\'the tailoring process could be vast involving several combinations of frameworks, practices, tools, and methods.\\', \\'each organization tends to tailor models in their  own  ways  based  on  their  past  experiences.\\', \\'by  interviewing  practitioners  and integrating  best  methods  and  practices,  future  practitioners  can  use  proven  ways  to implement dase projects.\\', \\'additionally, there are a vast number of frameworks and tools available that attempt to solve dase issues – frameworks and tools for distributed story capture,  development  collaboration,  and  tracking  quality  assurance.\\', \\'a  study  could  be conducted by experimenting between various frameworks and tools to better understand what works best in dase under different circumstances.\\', \\'in  our  study,  it  was  noted  that  tailored  methodologies,  such  as  scrumup,  lean development and scrum, and scrum and xp explicitly reported higher success compared to non-tailored methodologies [6].\\', \\'ways in which these methods were tailored was not described.\\', \\'further studies could be conducted on tailored methodologies to see if fewer challenges  are  faced  when  working  with  tailored  methodologies  using  distributed resources.\\', \\'additionally,  as  mentioned  above,  success  and  failure  criteria  could  be  well defined to assess the outcome of tailored methodologies.\\', \\'3.\\', \\'4.\\', \\'a majority of issues reported in this study fell under the communication and collaboration category.\\', \\'this is due to the fact that agile methods require higher level of coordination and  communication  while  both  coordination  and  communication  are  the  most  difficult when  working  with  distributed  human  resources.\\', \\'architecture  centric  design  proposed 40 cways to minimize or
