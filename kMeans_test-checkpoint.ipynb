      "['\\n\\nHealth planners and policy-makers face complex decisions requiring\\na deep knowledge of ‘healthcare systems’, which consist of all the or-\\nganizations, people and actions involved in maintaining, restoring and\\nenhancing human well-being. The characteristics of healthcare systems\\nare considered as an important indicator of population health (e.g.,\\nquality of life for people in developing integrated smart systems for\\ncities or regions) (Ismagilova, Hughes, Dwivedi, & Raman, 2019). There\\nis signiﬁcant variation in policy, funding and delivery of health care\\nacross regions (Griﬃn et al., 2016). Understanding these diﬀerences\\nand how they impact on the health of communities requires reliable\\nevidence, and health planners can use this evidence to drive systematic\\nquality improvement of regional healthcare delivery.\\n\\nThe growing availability of healthcare data raises the prospect of\\nbetter evidence-informed decision-making. Healthcare systems involve\\n\\nand\\n\\nchange,\\n\\nconstant\\n\\nvariability\\n\\ncomplex interactions between structures, processes, outcomes and\\nagents. They are characterized by nonlinearity, interconnectivity, self-\\norganization,\\nuncertainty\\n(Kannampallil, Schauer, Cohen, & Patel, 2011; Lipsitz, 2012; Long,\\nMcDermott, & Meadows, 2018). Mental health care epitomizes this\\ncomplexity. Mental illness often has both health and social dimensions\\n(Salvador‐Carulla, Haro, & Ayuso‐Mateos, 2006). For health planners to\\ndrive quality improvement, useful data must reﬂect the complexity of\\nmental health care. However, capitalizing on this evolution has been\\nhampered by diﬃculties in data analysis and limited human ability to\\nprocess information. (Caban & Gotz, 2015).\\n\\nVisual analytics plays an important role in more eﬀectively ana-\\nlyzing mental healthcare data. It refers to the suite of tools combining\\nautomated analysis techniques with visualizations, and the analytical\\ncapabilities of users, to capitalize on complex data to improve under-\\nstanding and decision-making (Keim, Kohlhammer, & Ellis, 2010;\\n\\nAbbreviations: GIS, geographic information systems; KDD, knowledge discovery in databases; AI, artiﬁcial intelligence\\n⁎ Corresponding author.\\nE-mail address: younjin.chung@anu.edu.au (Y.

The speed of this\\nevolution has generated new challenges for translating complex data into eﬀective evidence-informed policy.\\nVisual analytics oﬀers new capacity to analyze healthcare systems and support better decision-making. We\\nconducted a systematic scoping review to look for evidence of visual analytics approaches being applied to\\nmental healthcare systems and their use in driving policy. We found 79 relevant studies and categorized them in\\ntwo ways: by study purpose and by type of visualization. The majority (67.1%) of the studies used geographical\\nmaps, and 11% conducted highly complex studies requiring novel visualizations. Signiﬁcantly, only 15% of the\\nstudies provided information indicating high levels of usability for policy and planning. Our ﬁndings suggest that\\nwhile visual analytics continues to evolve rapidly, there is a need to ensure this evolution reﬂects the practical\\nneeds of policy makers.\\n\\n1. '\n",
      " '\\n\\nThis systematic scoping review was conducted to illustrate the ap-\\nplication of visual analytics to data analysis and decision support in\\nmental health systems settings. It presents a sample of the variety of\\nwork being performed around the world. This review demonstrates the\\ncomplexity of data, the type of study, the type of visualizations and the\\nimpact of visual analytics as practically applied to mental healthcare\\nsystems and policy planning. Our ﬁndings indicate that most of the\\nstudies used geographical maps for visual analytics of mental health-\\ncare systems. The dearth of visualization tools providing abstract in-\\nformation for highly complex data indicates a major gap between ex-\\nisting and novel visualization methods as applied to mental health.\\nContinuing to develop visual analytics approaches, engaging domain\\nexperts in better understanding the role of visual analytics and ensuring\\ntheir genuine impact in better decision-making are the key next steps\\nfor this emerging research area.\\n\\nAuthors’ contributions\\n\\nYC contributed to the study design, data search, data mapping, and\\ndata review and analysis; wrote the original draft manuscript; and in-\\ncorporated revisions from each of the co-authors.

We\\nconducted a systematic scoping review to look for evidence of visual analytics approaches being applied to\\nmental healthcare systems and their use in driving policy. We found 79 relevant studies and categorized them in\\ntwo ways: by study purpose and by type of visualization. The majority (67.1%) of the studies used geographical\\nmaps, and 11% conducted highly complex studies requiring novel visualizations. Signiﬁcantly, only 15% of the\\nstudies provided information indicating high levels of usability for policy and planning. Our ﬁndings suggest that\\nwhile visual analytics continues to evolve rapidly, there is a need to ensure this evolution reﬂects the practical\\nneeds of policy makers.\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nHealth planners and policy-makers face complex decisions requiring\\na deep knowledge of ‘healthcare systems’, which consist of all the or-\\nganizations, people and actions involved in maintaining, restoring and\\nenhancing human well-being. The characteristics of healthcare systems\\nare considered as an important indicator of population health (e.g.,\\nquality of life for people in developing integrated smart systems for\\ncities or regions) (Ismagilova, Hughes, Dwivedi, & Raman, 2019). There\\nis signiﬁcant variation in policy, funding and delivery of health care\\nacross regions (Griﬃn et al., 2016). Understanding these diﬀerences\\nand how they impact on the health of communities requires reliable\\nevidence, and health planners can use this evidence to drive systematic\\nquality improvement of regional healthcare delivery.\\n\\nThe growing availability of healthcare data raises the prospect of\\nbetter evidence-informed decision-making. Healthcare systems involve\\n\\nand\\n\\nchange,\\n\\nconstant\\n\\nvariability\\n\\ncomplex interactions between structures, processes, outcomes and\\nagents. They are characterized by nonlinearity, interconnectivity, self-\\norganization,\\nuncertainty\\n(Kannampallil, Schauer, Cohen, & Patel, 2011; Lipsitz, 2012; Long,\\nMcDermott, & Meadows, 2018). Mental health care epitomizes this\\ncomplexity. Mental illness often has both health and social dimensions\\n(Salvador‐Carulla, Haro, & Ayuso‐Mateos, 2006). For health planners to\\ndrive quality improvement, useful data must reﬂect the complexity of\\nmental health care. However, capitalizing on this evolution has been\\nhampered by diﬃculties in data analysis and limited human ability to\\nprocess information. (Caban & Gotz, 2015).\\n\\nVisual analytics plays an important role in more eﬀectively ana-\\nlyzing mental healthcare data. It refers to the suite of tools combining\\nautomated analysis techniques with visualizations, and the analytical\\ncapabilities of users, to capitalize on complex data to improve under-\\nstanding and decision-making (Keim, Kohlhammer, & Ellis, 2010;\\n\\nAbbreviations: GIS, geographic information systems; KDD, knowledge discovery in databases; AI, artiﬁcial intelligence\\n⁎ Corresponding author.\\nE-mail address: younjin.chung@anu.edu.au (Y.

Chung, et al.\\n\\nInternational Journal of Information Management 50 (2020) 17–27\\n\\nKohlhammer, Keim, Pohl, Santucci, & Andrienko, 2011; Ruppert,\\n2018). While traditional data analysis approaches such as statistics and\\nprobabilities can be used to measure the complexity and uncertainty of\\ndata, they are notoriously diﬃcult to communicate eﬀectively to deci-\\nsion-makers (Spiegelhalter, Pearson, & Short, 2011). Visual analytics\\npermits the synthesis of data from various sources, the communication\\nand use of complex data in exploring information, generating under-\\nstanding, eliciting implicit knowledge and developing evidence-in-\\nformed decision-making (Lavis, Permanand, Oxman, Lewin, &\\nFretheim, 2009; McInerny et al., 2014; Robinson, 2016). It also pro-\\nvides new capacity to derive insight from massive, dynamic and un-\\ncertain data. It can detect expected and unexpected pattern informa-\\ntion; provide timely, defensible and understandable assessments; and\\ncommunicate these assessments eﬀectively for action (Chung et al.,\\n2018; Kohlhammer et al., 2011; Ola & Sedig, 2016). Over the last\\ndecade a range of visual analytics approaches have emerged and been\\nwidely applied to scientiﬁc discovery and innovation in health sciences\\nsuch as infectious disease control (Carroll et al., 2014), personal health\\ninformation of patients (Faisal, Blandford, & Potts, 2013), and health-\\ncare ecosystems research (Furst, Gandré, Romero-Lopez-Alberca, &\\nSalvador-Carulla, 2019). Despite the signiﬁcance of these contributions,\\nthe role of visual analytics has been largely unexplored in the scientiﬁc\\nliterature on healthcare systems research and policy (Lavrač et al.,\\n2007; Moraga, 2017; Sopan et al., 2012).\\n\\nIn this scoping review, we summarize and analyze this evidence.\\n\\nThe objectives of this review are:\\n\\ni) to investigate and identify the existing literature regarding the ap-\\n\\nplication of visual analytics to mental healthcare systems;\\n\\nii) to map and categorize this literature according to study purpose (its\\nintended aim), data complexity, analytical methods, visualization\\ntypes, analytical results and interpretation, policy implication,\\nbeneﬁts and limitations of using visualizations; and\\n\\niii) to synthesize evidence demonstrating the practical application of\\nvisual analytics to mental healthcare systems research and policy.\\n\\n2. Material and methods\\n\\nWe conducted a systematic scoping review to identify and map the\\nliterature concerning the application of visualization tools for analysing\\nhealthcare systems and evidence-informed decision support in mental\\nhealth. This review identiﬁed and selected relevant studies, mapped\\nevidence; collated and summarized results and identiﬁed ﬁndings and\\ngaps in the research. Following published guidance on scoping reviews\\n(Arksey & O’Malley, 2005; Colquhoun et al., 2014; Levac, Colquhoun, &\\nO’Brien, 2010; Peters, Godfrey, McInerney et al., 2015; Peters, Godfrey,\\nKhalil et al., 2015), we used an iterative and parallel process to be\\nﬂexible in the search, screening, mapping and reviewing phases.\\n\\n2.1. Data selection and evaluation\\n\\nThe scoping review focused on examining the following question: to\\nwhat extent are visualization tools applied to analyze mental healthcare\\nsystems in supporting evidence-informed decisions? The search strategy\\nlooked for studies where visualization tools were deployed to under-\\nstand complex mental healthcare systems. This meant our criteria to\\nidentify studies in this review included several areas of mental health\\ncare:\\n• mental healthcare services (local, regional, national and interna-\\ntional);\\n• population mental health and epidemiology;\\n• policy and legislation;\\n• resource availability and allocation; and\\n• involvement of domain experts in service delivery and planning.\\n\\nStudies using visual analytics on clinical trials, genomic informa-\\ntion, individual decision-making and dashboards were excluded, unless\\nthey addressed policy impact on mental healthcare resources and ser-\\nvices. Due to cost and time constraints we mainly included English-\\nlanguage peer-reviewed studies (Arksey & O’Malley, 2005).\\n\\nWe identiﬁed the search terms and reﬁned the selection criteria\\nfurther by reviewing a random sample of publications from the search\\nresults. A comprehensive search was completed in July 2018 using the\\nﬁnal combination of search terms, (visual* OR graph* OR geograph*\\nOR geospatial OR spatial OR diagram* OR map*) AND (mental OR\\npsychiatr*) AND (decision OR policy OR plan* OR provision) AND\\n(health system OR health service OR health care), to three databases:\\nPubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Duplicated publications\\nfrom diﬀerent databases were arranged using a citation management\\nsystem (EndNote) and manually. The studies were then selected in steps\\nby title, abstract and full-text screening. For quality control purposes at\\neach step, two independent researchers (YC and KS) reviewed and ap-\\nplied the selection criteria to the studies in parallel. A third researcher\\n(JS) joined the agreement process to ensure that all relevant studies\\nwere included in the review. We also conducted a citation search from\\nour own and colleagues’ records to identify additional studies known to\\nbe missed from the database search. For inclusion in our search, access\\nto full-text of the studies was required. When this was not freely\\navailable we made direct requests to authors.\\n\\nDrawing on the search results, we collected evidence and iteratively\\ndeveloped summary to evaluate the identiﬁed literature, according to\\nthe following topics: study aim; study area (region); data type; layer of\\nanalytical information; methodology; computational analysis; visuali-\\nzation type; study results; policy implication; and beneﬁts and limita-\\ntions of using visualizations. Two independent researchers (EW and\\nMF) applied the summary topics to all included studies, and the process\\nwas checked for consistency and accuracy by a third researcher (YC).\\nAny changes were discussed by both researchers and a ﬁnal decision\\narrived at through consensus with the third researcher.\\n\\n2.2. Data analysis and mapping\\n\\nWe developed summary descriptions of the application of visuali-\\nzation tools to mental healthcare systems, showing the scope of the\\nresearch found. We have presented our ﬁndings not only to show how\\nvisual analytics tools are currently used, but also to consider implica-\\ntions for future research and practice.\\n\\nWe developed a typology to categorize visualization types by the\\nkey purpose or analytical tasks of each study, aiming to demonstrate\\ntheir variation as applied to mental healthcare systems. We then as-\\nsessed the tendency of the studies over time to identify gaps for future\\nwork in mental healthcare systems research. The ﬁnal aspect of this\\nscoping review assessed the practical applicability of the visual analy-\\ntics by evaluating the complexity and usability of the studies.\\n\\nThe complexity was measured using three attributes as seen in\\n\\nTable 1:\\n\\n1) the number of information layers to be analyzed and viewed using\\n\\nvisualizations;\\n\\n2) the level of ‘graphicacy’ (the ability to understand and use a map or\\ngraph) (Kennedy, 2015) for visual interpretation and communica-\\ntion; and\\n\\n3) the complexity of computational analysis method to produce ana-\\n\\nlytical information.\\n\\nThe complexity attributes were scored with the values of 0 (low)\\nand 1 (high) based on the sizes of data and variables used. We deﬁned\\nthe values of graphicacy based on the types of visualization tools, di-\\nvided into two categories (Pantazos, Lauesen, & Vatrapu, 2013):\\n\\n1) tools that require advanced skills or knowledge from large audiences\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\x0cTable 1\\nMeasures of the study complexity and usability.\\n\\nY.

Conceptual mapping of visualizations\\n\\n2) tools that produce the visual information in familiar and predeﬁned\\nway to large audiences requiring very basic skills or knowledge for\\nits interpretation.\\n\\nThe graphicacy was scored 1 if a study used visualization tools that\\nrequire advanced skill of knowledge, otherwise 0. Two researchers (YC\\nand JS) separately scored the graphicacy of the main visualization\\ngraph used in each study. To make scoring fairer, the two researchers\\nreferred to the beneﬁts and limitations of the visualization tools as\\ndiscussed in the publications. The interrater reliability of the graphi-\\ncacy scores was measured using the Kappa coeﬃcient (k) to synthesize\\nthe quality of the evaluation results (Cohen, 1960; McHugh, 2012). For\\nquality control and ﬁnal decision on the scores, a third researcher (NB)\\njoined the process. A ﬁnal decision on the graphicacy scores was\\nreached through consensus with the third researcher. The aggregation\\nof these scores provided the complexity levels from 0 to 3 (from low to\\nhigh) in our review.\\n\\nThe usability was measured using another three attributes as de-\\n\\nscribed in Table 1:\\n\\n1) the funding strategy (e.g., direct funding or co-funding from health\\n\\norganizations and public agencies);\\n\\n2) the participation of domain experts (e.g., stakeholders with co-au-\\n\\n3) the policy impact of the study (e.g., reference to a speciﬁc policy\\n\\nthorship); and\\n\\nproblem in the study).\\n\\nThe usability attributes were also scored with the values of 0 and 1\\nbased on ‘no’ and ‘yes’ categories, respectively. The funding strategy\\nwas scored 1 if a study was supported by any relevant local or global\\nhealth organizations, otherwise 0. The participation of domain experts\\nwas scored 1 if any non-academic experts were involved in a study,\\notherwise 0. The policy impact was scored 1 if there was a speciﬁc\\nstatement linking the study to a policy problem. In order to assess the\\noverall usability, we provided the aggregated scores of these three at-\\ntributes from 0 to 3 (low to high).\\n\\n3. Results\\n\\nThe database search yielded a total of 2413 publications. This was\\nreduced to 2012 after removal of duplicates (see Fig. 1 for a summary of\\nthe screening process). After screening titles and abstracts from the\\nsearch results, we found 131 publications and identiﬁed a further 23\\npublications based on our knowledge, meaning the initial selection\\nincluded 154 publications for the full-text screening. We were unable to\\nretrieve the full-text of four publications so they were excluded from the\\nfull-text screening. Another 71 publications were also excluded as they\\ndid not meet the inclusion criteria described above. After the full-text\\nscreening, a total of 79 publications were selected for ﬁnal inclusion in\\nthe scoping review. The topic of the included studies was extracted for\\nreview and comparison in a summary table (refer to Appendix).\\n\\nThe 79 studies were mapped into a conceptual framework (see\\nTable 2). This framework allowed us to apply the typology developed to\\ncategorize the studies by visualization type and study purpose/analy-\\ntical tasks. Three main tasks were identiﬁed: descriptive; non-geospatial\\nand geospatial analysis. The ﬁrst two tasks involve abstract information\\nthat do not require geospatial information while the latter requires\\ngeospatial information for their data analyses (Tory & Moller, 2004).\\nWhile descriptive analysis was deﬁned for relatively simple bivariate\\ndata with statistical measures, non-geospatial analysis was deﬁned for\\nmultivariate data with more complex measures (e.g., using multiple\\nregression or multi-dimensional scaling methods) in this review. The\\nvisualizations were then further categorized into six broad types: geo-\\ngraphical map; mixed geographical map and other graphs; association\\ngraphs; variation graphs; diagram; and novel visualizations, referring to\\nanalytical\\ntargets (e.g., data, attributes, network and geospatial)\\n(Munzner, 2014). Graphs such as bar, curve and scatter plots were\\nconsidered as ‘association graphs’ if they were used for studies on as-\\nsociation analysis that included analysis of correlation, prediction,\\nclustering, and pattern. Graphs such as bar, line and radar plots were\\nconsidered as ‘variation graphs’ if they were used for studies on var-\\niation analysis that included analysis of spatial and/or temporal change\\nand diﬀerence comparison.\\n\\nAs seen in Table 2, 40.5% of the included studies referred to geos-\\npatial studies related to service access, variation, association and uti-\\nlisation. All these geospatial studies used geographical maps for visual\\nanalytics. Half of them also used other supported graphs for association\\nanalysis. Many of the descriptive studies focused on variation analysis\\nand used variation graphs. Many of these descriptive studies also used\\ngeographical maps to present the descriptive information. Geographical\\nmaps were also used for some of non-geospatial studies. Overall, 67.1%\\nof the studies in this review used geographical maps for analyzing\\nhealthcare systems in mental health. The rest of the studies used other\\nvisualization techniques (association or variation graphs based on their\\ntasks). Only a small number of the studies (2.5%) attempted to use\\nrelatively novel visualization forms (e.g., Cluster Panel Map and Self-\\nOrganising Map) when analyzing complex patterns of mental health-\\ncare systems.\\n\\n3.2. Tendency mapping of studies\\n\\nWe mapped our evaluation of the 79 identiﬁed studies into the three\\nmain tasks (descriptive, geospatial and non-geospatial analysis), by 5-\\nyear periods. As shown in Fig. 2, the earliest study was conducted in\\n1988, analysing non-geospatial\\ninformation of mental\\nhealthcare systems. Studies on descriptive analysis were the most\\ncommon task between 2000 and 2004. Since 2005 the most common\\ntask has been geospatial analysis, with non-geospatial analysis emer-\\nging more recently, reﬂecting increased demand for understanding\\ncomplex mental healthcare systems at a high (abstract) level.\\n\\n(abstract)\\n\\nUsing the same periods, we also mapped the studies by geographic\\norigin. As shown in Fig. 3, the majority (32 studies, 41.25%) of the\\nstudies were European (Spain, UK, France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland,\\nSweden and Netherlands) with 36.25% (30 studies) from North\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\x0cY.

The\\ninterrater reliability of the graphicacy scores given to the visualization\\n\\nFig. 2. The tendency of the studies based on 5-year periods for diﬀerent analytical tasks.\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\x0cY.

The tendency of the studies based on 5-year periods worldwide.\\n\\ntools showed substantial agreement (k = 0.71) for measuring the\\ncomplexity of the studies.\\n\\nAs shown in Fig. 4, visual analytics was applicable for most of the\\nmoderately useable studies through all levels of the study complexity\\n(10%+18%+9%+5%+8%+22%+4%+5% = 81%). However,\\nthe\\npractical applicability of visual analytics appeared relatively low for\\nhighly complex studies (5%+5%+1% = 11%) and very low for these\\nstudies even if they were able to demonstrate strong support from re-\\nlevant health organisations. Only 15% (3%+8%+3%+1%) of the\\nstudies provided information that indicated high levels of usability in\\npolicy and practice. The practical applicability of visual analytics also\\nappeared very low for studies that were not able to demonstrate any\\nsupport from a relevant health organization and none if they were very\\ncomplex. Fig. 4 also shows the distribution of three main visualization\\ntypes (geographical maps, graphs/diagrams, novel visualizations) used\\nfor the studies by impact rating. This demonstrates low practical ap-\\nplicability of visual analytics involving high complexity and usability,\\nas more novel visualization approaches were required to generate im-\\npact.\\n\\n4. Discussion\\n\\nGiven the growing availability of data in health care, there is an\\nincreasing need for investment in visual analytics approaches to assist\\nevidence-informed decision-making (Robinson, 2016). Mental health\\nshould be a high priority area for these developments due to: its mixture\\nof health and social care needs; the complexity and ambiguity of mental\\ndisorders; and the interface between mental and physical care\\n(Salvador‐Carulla et al., 2006). To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst at-\\ntempt to conduct a scoping of the literature related to the application of\\nvisual analytics to mental healthcare systems. It has incorporated a\\nmethod for categorizing and assessing the literature on this topic.\\n\\n4.1. Findings and gaps\\n\\nThis review reveals three main ﬁndings. First, much of the existing\\nliterature refers to the use of geographical maps in understanding\\nmental healthcare systems. This has limited capacity to represent\\ncomplex non-geospatial information at a high level. The second notable\\n\\nFig. 4.

Chung, et al.\\n\\nInternational Journal of Information Management 50 (2020) 17–27\\n\\nﬁnding is the increase of non-geospatial studies. This shows that a key\\nemerging challenge for researchers is to select the visualization tools\\nbest suited for the study task and audience. The third interesting ﬁnding\\nis the absence of literature indicating where the application of visual\\nanalytics with highly complex data has actually driven policy or\\nfunding decisions. In other words, it is not easy to ﬁnd clear evidence\\nthat visualization techniques have actually been useful to decision-\\nmakers. There is clearly a need to ensure that health organizations and\\npublic agencies better understand the value of visual analytics so that it\\nbecomes part of routine practice in decision-making. Other ﬁndings to\\nnote are the regional diﬀerences identiﬁed in the number and sophis-\\ntication of studies using visualization tools. Although this issue was not\\na key part of the scope of this review it is interesting to note European\\nleadership in the ﬁeld.\\n\\nthe 1990s,\\n\\nOur review suggests that studies using only geographical maps may\\nnot be the best way to present complex information and associations.\\nThroughout\\nthe Geographic Information System (GIS)\\ntechnology has been widely adopted for geospatial studies both in re-\\nsearch and practice (Tate, 2018). Its application in mental healthcare\\nsystems planning took oﬀ in the 2000s, as data became more available\\nacross Europe, North America and Oceania. However, the increase of\\nliterature on non-geospatial analysis of large and complex mental\\nhealthcare systems has required novel visualization technologies with\\nthe use of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) techniques for evidence-informed\\nknowledge discovery and decision support (Duan, Edwards, & Dwivedi,\\n2019). Most visualization tools face considerable challenges in trying to\\ndisplay complex and multidimensional information that is analysed\\nusing AI techniques but does not require geospatial information. It is\\ndiﬃcult\\ninformation into geo-\\ngraphical maps given these maps rely on ﬁxed geospatial information.\\nSurmounting this problem requires incorporating additional visualiza-\\ntions (e.g., graphs or symbols) into geographical maps, using alter-\\nnatives, or developing novel visualization approaches. Various visuali-\\nzation methods are available and can be tailored depending on the task.\\nThis review indicates that the diversity of visualization tools applied to\\nmental healthcare systems is still\\nlow considering the alternatives\\navailable (Spiegelhalter et al., 2011). Common visualization tools cur-\\nrently used in other thematic areas, such as alluvial diagrams, rose-like\\ngraphs and roulette wheels (Grant, 2015), are rarely used in mental\\nhealthcare systems research and evidence-informed policy planning.\\n\\nto incorporate necessary abstract\\n\\nVisualisation plays an important role in incorporating domain ex-\\nperts in the whole process of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)\\nand supporting evidence-informed decisions by domain experts\\n(Fayyad, Piatetsky-Shapiro, & Smyth, 1996; Gibert, Sànchez-Marrè, &\\nCodina, 2010; López, Sanchez, & Micó, 2014; Thornicroft, Ruggeri, &\\nGoldberg, 2013). Understanding complex mental healthcare data also\\nrequires the engagement of domain experts in the process of KDD (pre-,\\nmid- and post-processing phases) (Chung et al., 2018). The interactive\\ncapacity of visual analytics enables domain experts to sort, ﬁlter and\\nexplore data. There is evidence that this interaction leads to better\\nunderstanding, clearer communication and increased likelihood that\\nthe analysis will eﬀectively inﬂuence practical decision-making (Gatto,\\n2015). This has increasingly ﬁlled a crucial information gap when\\nanalysts and domain experts come to explore and communicate the\\nwealth of information being produced particularly in the mid-proces-\\nsing phase of KDD, between the development of expert prior knowledge\\nand the interpretation of analytical results (McInerny et al., 2014;\\nSalvador-Carulla et al., 2010).\\n\\nHowever, identifying and displaying meaningful abstract informa-\\ntion using visualizations remains a challenge for several reasons. First,\\nsome domain experts may have limited graphicacy skills. Their skills\\nmay be further tested due to the size and complexity of the data pre-\\nsented. Also, some visual analytics tools might be diﬃcult for the tar-\\ngeted audience (e.g., policy-makers) to use and understand. The richer\\nand more complex information presented using visual analytics tools\\nmight make it diﬃcult to establish clear understanding about what to\\n\\ndo or what messages to communicate. This might inﬂuence the late\\nadoption and diﬀusion of visual analytics in healthcare systems re-\\nsearch and policy. A multidisciplinary collaboration (e.g., infography,\\nvisual arts and marketing) with domain experts in the development of\\nvisual analytics can be highly relevant for improving the use of novel\\nvisualization tools by decision-makers. There will be huge opportunities\\nfor studies to engage domain experts, improve the use of visualizations\\nand drive increased research eﬀorts (Kohlhammer et al., 2011;\\nMcInerny et al., 2014).\\n\\n4.2. Strengths and limitations\\n\\nThe key strength of this scoping review is its originality - the\\npractical applicability of visual analytics to mental healthcare systems.\\nIt is hoped our ﬁndings allow researchers and domain experts to obtain\\na strategic view of the potential power of visual analytics to drive better\\npolicy and decision-making in mental health care. Our approach re-\\nquires corroboration by other research groups. Our strong involvement\\nin mental healthcare systems research may have produced a selection\\nbias. We have tried to overcome this issue by incorporating in-\\ndependent raters (KS and EW) who were not previously involved in this\\nresearch. The review should trigger continued debate about the direc-\\ntion of growth of visual analytics for evidence-informed decision-\\nmaking in mental health and beyond.\\n\\nThe main limitation of our review is the extent to which the search\\nstrategy does not list all visualization types currently available. Our\\nsearch strategy put more weight on the geospatial terms for visualiza-\\ntion and, as a result, we may have missed some relevant literature on\\nnovel visualizations. Similarly, since we focused on visual analytics for\\nmental healthcare systems, other mental health studies were not con-\\nsidered in this review. This could have resulted in missing some re-\\nlevant studies from the initial screening phases, or the search terms\\ncould not index them properly in the database search. To address any\\ngap, we conducted a citation search for the review and considered a\\nfurther 23 publications at the full-text screening phase. A ﬁnal limita-\\ntion was that overall there seemed to be a paucity of relevant literature,\\nmeaning our eventual sample size was small.\\n\\n4.3. Future work\\n\\nThe emergence of specialists and visual analytics laboratories both\\nin academia and in the public sector is already apparent and important.\\nThe increasing interest in this topic will guide the next stage of evo-\\nlution of visual analytics technology and eventually result in better\\ntools to inﬂuence policy, funding and the quality of services for people\\nwith mental illnesses. This could include the suitability of visual ana-\\nlytics technologies in response to the recent evolution of digital health\\nservices towards gamiﬁcation (Koivisto & Hamari, 2019), amazoniﬁ-\\ncation (Desjardins, 2018) and real-time dashboard initiative (Kitchin,\\nLauriault, & McArdle, 2015). These techniques are critical in devel-\\noping, monitoring and supporting digital health services and activities\\nto design eﬀective mental healthcare interventions for right people at\\nright places (Dwivedi, Shareef, Simintiras, Lal, & Weerakkody, 2016).\\nThe great challenges ahead are developing novel visualizations; in-\\ncreasing the graphicacy skills of domain experts in relation to visual\\nanalytics technology; and improving the quality of information gener-\\nated by new visualization tools.\\n\\nAnother area for future research is a detailed analysis of speciﬁc\\nareas of visualization such as the use of geographical maps over other\\nvisualizations. Given its predominance in the sector, a systematic re-\\nview on this type of visualization would be desirable. It may also be\\nrelevant to explore national and regional diﬀerences in the develop-\\nment and use of visualization tools identiﬁed in this review. The\\nadoption of systems thinking and complexity approaches to mental\\nhealth planning in Europe and the priorities of European health funding\\nschemes could have played a role in these ﬁndings (Dattée & Barlow,\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\x0cY. Chung, et al.\\n\\nInternational Journal of Information Management 50 (2020) 17–27\\n\\n2010; Forsman et al., 2015; Hazo et al., 2017; Iruin-Sanz, Pereira-\\nRodríguez, & Nuño-Solinís, 2015).\\n\\nFinally, this scoping review can contribute to the future develop-\\nment of a framework or guidelines for the use of visual analytics tools in\\nmental healthcare systems research. Such a framework would help re-\\nsearchers and decision-makers capitalize on these tools, choosing the\\nmost appropriate and useful to meet their needs.\\n\\n5. Conclusions\\n\\nThis systematic scoping review was conducted to illustrate the ap-\\nplication of visual analytics to data analysis and decision support in\\nmental health systems settings. It presents a sample of the variety of\\nwork being performed around the world. This review demonstrates the\\ncomplexity of data, the type of study, the type of visualizations and the\\nimpact of visual analytics as practically applied to mental healthcare\\nsystems and policy planning. Our ﬁndings indicate that most of the\\nstudies used geographical maps for visual analytics of mental health-\\ncare systems. The dearth of visualization tools providing abstract in-\\nformation for highly complex data indicates a major gap between ex-\\nisting and novel visualization methods as applied to mental health.\\nContinuing to develop visual analytics approaches, engaging domain\\nexperts in better understanding the role of visual analytics and ensuring\\ntheir genuine impact in better decision-making are the key next steps\\nfor this emerging research area.\\n\\nAuthors’ contributions\\n\\nYC contributed to the study design, data search, data mapping, and\\ndata review and analysis; wrote the original draft manuscript; and in-\\ncorporated revisions from each of the co-authors.

tomental healthcare systems is stilllow considering the alternativesavailable (spiegelhalter et al., 2011).', 'common visualization tools cur-rently used in other thematic areas, such as alluvial diagrams, rose-likegraphs and roulette wheels (grant, 2015), are rarely used in mentalhealthcare systems research and evidence-informed policy planning.to incorporate necessary abstractvisualisation plays an important role in incorporating domain ex-perts in the whole process of knowledge discovery in databases (kdd)and supporting evidence-informed decisions by domain experts(fayyad, piatetsky-shapiro, & smyth, 1996; gibert, sànchez-marrè, &codina, 2010; lópez, sanchez, & micó, 2014; thornicroft, ruggeri, &goldberg, 2013).', 'understanding complex mental healthcare data alsorequires the engagement of domain experts in the process of kdd (pre-,mid- and post-processing phases) (chung et al., 2018).', 'the interactivecapacity of visual analytics enables domain experts to sort, ﬁlter andexplore data.', 'there is evidence that this interaction leads to betterunderstanding, clearer communication and increased likelihood thatthe analysis will eﬀectively inﬂuence practical decision-making (gatto,2015).', 'this has increasingly ﬁlled a crucial information gap whenanalysts and domain experts come to explore and communicate thewealth of information being produced particularly in the mid-proces-sing phase of kdd, between the development of expert prior knowledgeand the interpretation of analytical results (mcinerny et al., 2014;salvador-carulla et al., 2010).however, identifying and displaying meaningful abstract informa-tion using visualizations remains a challenge for several reasons.', 'first,some domain experts may have limited graphicacy skills.', 'their skillsmay be further tested due to the size and complexity of the data pre-sented.', 'also, some visual analytics tools might be diﬃcult for the tar-geted audience (e.g., policy-makers) to use and understand.', 'the richerand more complex information presented using visual analytics toolsmight make it diﬃcult to establish clear understanding about what todo or what messages to communicate.', 'this might inﬂuence the lateadoption and diﬀusion of visual analytics in healthcare systems re-search and policy.', 'a multidisciplinary collaboration (e.g., infography,visual arts and marketing) with domain experts in the development ofvisual analytics can be highly relevant for improving the use of novelvisualization tools by decision-makers.', 'there will be huge opportunitiesfor studies to engage domain experts, improve the use of visualizationsand drive increased research eﬀorts (kohlhammer et al., 2011;mcinerny et al., 2014).4.2.', 'strengths and limitationsthe key strength of this scoping review is its originality - thepractical applicability of visual analytics to mental healthcare systems.it is hoped our ﬁndings allow researchers and domain experts to obtaina strategic view of the potential power of visual analytics to drive betterpolicy and decision-making in mental health care.', 'our approach re-quires corroboration by other research groups.', 'our strong involvementin mental healthcare systems research may have produced a selectionbias.', 'we have tried to overcome this issue by incorporating in-dependent raters (ks and ew) who were not previously involved in thisresearch.', 'the review should trigger continued debate about the direc-tion of growth of visual analytics for evidence-informed decision-making in mental health and beyond.the main limitation of our review is the extent to which the searchstrategy does not list all visualization types currently available.', 'oursearch strategy put more weight on the geospatial terms for visualiza-tion and, as a result, we may have missed some relevant literature onnovel visualizations.', 'similarly, since we focused on visual analytics formental healthcare systems, other mental health studies were not con-sidered in this review.', 'this could have resulted in missing some re-levant studies from the initial screening phases, or the search termscould not index them properly in the database search.', 'to address anygap, we conducted a citation search for the review and considered afurther 23 publications at the full-text screening phase.', 'a ﬁnal limita-tion was that overall there seemed to be a paucity of relevant literature,meaning our eventual sample size was small.4.3.', 'future workthe emergence of specialists and visual analytics laboratories bothin academia and in the public sector is already apparent and important.the increasing interest in this topic will guide the next stage of evo-lution of visual analytics technology and eventually result in bettertools to inﬂuence policy, funding and the quality of services for peoplewith mental illnesses.', 'this could include the suitability of visual ana-lytics technologies in response to the recent evolution of digital healthservices towards gamiﬁcation (koivisto & hamari, 2019), amazoniﬁ-cation (desjardins, 2018) and real-time dashboard initiative (kitchin,lauriault, & mcardle, 2015).', 'these techniques are critical in devel-oping, monitoring and supporting digital health services and activitiesto design eﬀective mental healthcare interventions for right people atright places (dwivedi, shareef, simintiras, lal, & weerakkody, 2016).the great challenges ahead are developing novel visualizations; in-creasing the graphicacy skills of domain experts in relation to visualanalytics technology; and improving the quality of information gener-ated by new visualization tools.another area for future research is a detailed analysis of speciﬁcareas of visualization such as the use of geographical maps over othervisualizations.', 'given its predominance in the sector, a systematic re-view on this type of visualization would be desirable.', 'it may also berelevant to explore national and regional diﬀerences in the develop-ment and use of visualization tools identiﬁed in this review.', 'theadoption of systems thinking and complexity approaches to mentalhealth planning in europe and the priorities of european health fundingschemes could have played a role in these ﬁndings (dattée & barlow,23cy.', 'chung, et al.international journal of information management 50 (2020) 17–272010; forsman et al., 2015; hazo et al., 2017; iruin-sanz, pereira-rodríguez, & nuño-solinís, 2015).finally, this scoping review can contribute to the future develop-ment of a framework or guidelines for the use of visual analytics tools inmental healthcare systems research.', 'such a framework would help re-searchers and decision-makers capitalize on these tools, choosing themost appropriate and useful to meet their needs.5.', 'conclusionsthis systematic scoping review was conducted to illustrate the ap-plication of visual analytics to data analysis and decision support inmental health systems settings.', 'it presents a sample of the variety ofwork being performed around the world.', 'this review demonstrates thecomplexity of data, the type of study, the type of visualizations and theimpact of visual analytics as practically applied to mental healthcaresystems and policy planning.', 'our ﬁndings indicate that most of thestudies used geographical maps for visual analytics of mental health-care systems.', 'the dearth of visualization tools providing abstract in-formation for highly complex data indicates a major gap between ex-isting and novel visualization methods as applied to mental health.continuing to develop visual analytics approaches, engaging domainexperts in better understanding the role of visual analytics and ensuringtheir genuine impact in better decision-making are the key next stepsfor this emerging research area.authors’ contributionsyc contributed to the study design, data search, data mapping, anddata review and
