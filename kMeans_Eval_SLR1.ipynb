Hao et al. / Advanced Engineering Informatics 19 (2005) 123–134\\n\\nreview of projects related to conceptual design could be\\nfound in [1,7].\\n\\nDuring the past several years, we have been working on\\nthe development of collaborative environments for multi-\\ndisciplinary design optimization (MDO) and developed a\\nprototype software environment-WebBlow (a Web/agent\\nbased blow molded parts design and optimization environ-\\nment) [8–10]. In WebBlow, a multi-agent system is used to\\nintegrate blow molding process simulation, performance\\nsimulation and optimization algorithms.\\n\\nHowever, the development of an agent based industrial\\napplication is not an easy task. In building an agent based\\napplication, developers unavoidably meet the challenge of\\ninsufﬁcient support of agent level infrastructures. On the\\nother hand, in spite of the technical difﬁculties in developing\\nmulti-agent systems, the interoperability between hetero-\\ngeneous agents and agent systems is also very important. If\\none system does not interoperate with others, the general\\napplicability of the system in the engineering ﬁelds cannot\\nbe assured.\\n\\nFor the above reasons, the major objective of Foundation of\\nIntelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) [11] has been targeted to\\npromote the interoperability of heterogeneous agents and\\nagent systems. Moreover, with the mature of FIPA speciﬁca-\\ntions and the proliferation of FIPA compliant agent platforms\\nand toolkits,\\ntechnologies in\\nindustries are promisingly foreseeable. However, no one\\nexisting FIPA compliant agent platform or toolkit can easily\\nbe applied to develop engineering applications.\\n\\nthe applications of agent\\n\\nBased on comprehensive studies on FIPA speciﬁcations,\\nagent platforms, and agent applications, as well as more\\nthan ten years experience on the development of agent based\\nengineering design and manufacturing systems, we\\ndeveloped a light-weighted FIPA compliant agent frame-\\nwork called Autonomous Agent Development Environment\\n(AADE). It is worth pointing out that originating from the\\nperspective of engineering, the basic facilities provided by\\nAADE are open, ﬂexible and scalable, and are expected to\\naccelerate future research and development in agent based\\napplications in design and manufacturing.\\n\\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2\\nintroduces FIPA standards and compares three well-known\\nagent platforms that implement FIPA speciﬁcations; Section\\n3 presents the architecture of AADE, its main components,\\nand the distinguished characteristics; Section 4 describes the\\nsystem architecture of the agent based collaborative design\\nand engineering environment, its composed agents, and the\\ndeveloped software prototype based on AADE; Section 5\\nconcludes the paper with our contributions and future\\nconsiderations.\\n\\n2. FIPA compliant agent platforms\\n\\nAgent\\n\\nlevel abstraction in software\\nengineering. Agent based approaches alleviate the high\\n\\nis a higher\\n\\ncoupling of distributed objects by using a message passing\\ncommunication paradigm. In a multi-agent system, an agent\\nis characterized by its autonomous and cooperative\\ncapabilities, such as independent reasoning and local\\ndecision making, handling incoming messages and mana-\\nging multiple tasks at the same time. However, the agent\\ntechnology seems to be too complicated for practical\\napplications without the provision of essential components\\nthat form the baseline for agent system development\\nprocess. Moreover, for many reasons, agents developed by\\ndifferent organizations are difﬁcult to interoperate because\\nof the lack of a common messaging and ontology interface.\\nFIPA [11], founded in 1996, is an international standard-\\nization organization promoting the development and\\nspeciﬁcation of agent\\ntechnologies. The main goal for\\nFIPA speciﬁcations is to specify how different kinds of\\nagent platforms can interoperate. In the context of FIPA, an\\nagent is an encapsulated entity with its own states, behavior,\\nthread of control, and an ability to interact and communicate\\nwith other entities-including people, other agents, and\\nlegacy systems [12].\\n\\nFIPA offers a set of application independent speciﬁca-\\ntions which have covered almost all the topics concerning\\nagent technology, including agent life cycle management,\\nagent communication, ontology, agent mobility and\\nsecurity. Basically, FIPA abstract architecture speciﬁes:\\nin the directory facilitator (DF), a yellow page function-\\nality to support service registration and discovery; in the\\nagent management system (AMS), a white page function-\\nality to enforce agent naming service and agent life cycle\\nmanagement; and in the message transport service (MTS),\\nthe default communication method between agents on\\ndifferent agent platforms or within the same platform.\\nMTS may include an advanced message routing function-\\nalities (agent communication channel, ACC) on top of\\nsingle or multiple message transport protocols (MTP, such\\nas HTTP and IIOP). Fig. 1 shows the abstract architecture\\nof FIPA speciﬁcations.\\n\\nMTS is a ﬂexible part which could vary from one\\nagent platform to another. Some platforms use the MTS to\\nhandle only the cross-platform messages and let agents\\nwithin the same agent platform communicate directly;\\nwhile some other platforms use the MTS to handle all\\nmessages running both inside and outside its residing\\nagent platform.\\n\\nFIPA speciﬁcations have reached such a maturity that\\nFIPA compliant agent systems have been implemented by\\nvarious developers. More than one hundred agent toolkits or\\nplatforms have been developed and presented in the\\nliterature or on the Web, with different mixes of mobility,\\nadaptability, intelligence, ACL and multi-language support\\n[13]. Among them, three well known agent platforms are:\\nJADE [14,15], FIPA-OS [16,17] and Zeus [18,19]. Using\\nagents as the unit of encapsulation, all these three agent\\nplatforms can provide an agent code base that liberates\\ndevelopers from the laborious work of building basic agent\\n\\n\\x0cQ.

Second, the\\nlimitation of documentation and licensing problem hinder\\nits adaptability to engineering applications. Many\\nindustrial customers would like to protect their intellec-\\ntual property, which could not be guaranteed by codes\\nunder open-source agreement. Third, the code efﬁciency\\nis also a serious problem. Because the purpose of these\\nagent platforms is simply to break down general agent\\nfrom domain related problems from the viewpoint of\\ncomputer science discipline,\\ntarget may not be\\nbalanced and optimized to ﬁt special requirements of\\nengineering applications.\\n\\nthis\\n\\nIn this paper, we present an FIPA compliant agent\\nframework proposed and developed particularly for engin-\\neering applications.\\n\\n3.

In a non-exclusive modular\\nmodel, software modules (entities) conﬁned in different\\nboxes can access or utilize each other directly across their\\nboundaries. These relationships between modules could be\\ntoo complicated to draw in one single diagram. However, in\\nthe view of object encapsulation, these relationships can be\\nhided behind the external interfaces of Java classes.\\n\\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the agent infrastructures or common\\nfunctionalities are abstracted and associated with each agent\\nrole. There are four major packages developed in AADE.\\nThe following subsections describe these packages as well\\nas other domain dependant modules, and brieﬂy discuss the\\nimportant features of AADE.\\n\\n3.1.

FSM diagram of FIPA Request initiator.\\n\\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the Message Handling module\\ndeals with the payload of messages that are represented in\\nFIPA ACL, while the Conversation Control module\\nmaintains a conversation list, enforces the sequences of\\nFIPA protocols, and controls the states of conversations.\\nBecause the content in ACL is represented by the XML\\nformat, the corresponding ACL Parser is responsible for\\nunderstanding the meaning of content in message payload\\nafter the XML parser (in Utility package) distilling the\\npayload information.\\n\\nThe sequences of agent\\n\\ninteractions are represented\\nseparately as Finite State Machine (FSM) diagrams for each\\nagent roles. Taking FIPA Request protocol as an\\nexample, there are two agent roles participated in this\\nprotocol:\\nthe Initiator and the Participant. While the\\nsequence diagram in Fig. 3 provides a society level view\\nof interaction, the state machine charts in Fig. 4 represent\\nthe internal processing sequence of the agent performing the\\nInitiator\\nrole. This FSM based conversation control\\nmechanism is very powerful and because of its generality,\\nall kinds of FIPA protocols and even the user-deﬁned\\nprotocols can be easily expressed using this kind of\\nabstraction. Through the representation of FSM, the ‘data’\\nmodel and ‘control’ mechanism of protocols can be\\nseparated, making the protocols easily deﬁnable and the\\nprotocol management modules reusable.\\n\\n3.3. General function package\\n\\nBy referencing FIPA management speciﬁcations, we\\nabstract general functionalities that all agents commonly\\nshare with. These functionalities are packed as the\\nGeneral Function package.\\n\\nThe directory facilitator (DF) is a component in AADE\\nthat provides the white pages and yellow pages directory\\nservices to all other agents. It is an agent that combines\\n\\n\\x0c128\\n\\nQ. Hao et al. / Advanced Engineering Informatics 19 (2005) 123–134\\n\\nto register\\n\\nthe functionalities of AMS and DF described in FIPA. The\\nresponsibility of Registration module is to handle\\nregistration functions on both sides of agents (either DF\\nagent or agents other than DF). The agent identiﬁcation\\n(AID), including agent name and its transport descriptions,\\nis registered to the DF agent.\\nIn particular, special\\ninformation of agents representing engineering resources\\n(PS Agents as described in Section 4) is included in agent’s\\nconﬁguration ﬁle to enable an agent\\nits\\nengineering capabilities (domain dependant) as well. The\\noperations concerning registration process include: reg-\\nister, deregister, modify, search, push-\\nRegistry and the leaseTime control mechanism.\\nAmong these operations, only pushRegistry is not\\nspeciﬁed in FIPA. We designed this operation originating\\nfrom the DF to other agents to push the new updates of agent\\nregistry to all agents listed on the current registration table.\\nFrom implementation point of view, the major difference\\nbetween pushRegistry and other operations is that it is\\nimplemented through a one-way message rather than a\\ncomplete conversation. Because the system does not need to\\ncheck and guarantee whether the receiver could actually get\\nthe updates,\\nthe workload of system and network is\\nsigniﬁcantly reduced.\\n\\nSimilar to the Registration module, Scheduling\\nand Agent Management modules provide supports for\\nregular software maintenance (such as backup, restore,\\nlogging and exceptions, from the viewpoint of software\\nengineering) and overseeing the transition of agent states in\\nmultiple conversations (from the viewpoint of agent\\nengineering), respectively. The speciﬁcations of FIPA\\nagent management system (AMS) are partially implemented\\nto meet the requirements of agent lift cycle management in\\nAADE.\\n\\n3.4. Utility package\\n\\nAlthough agent is believed to represent a higher level of\\nabstraction in software engineering, it still needs to possess\\nbasic functionalities that any software entity should have. In\\nthe utility package, we provide an agent with some software\\nengineering facilities, such as database operations, ﬁle\\noperations, FTP client, email handling, exception handling,\\nlogging operations, XML parsing, general interface com-\\nponents, and various zipping classes (for message security\\nand encoding).\\n\\n3.5. Domain dependant modules\\n\\nIn AADE, application-speciﬁc agents can be constructed\\nby customizing the interfaces of the generic agent model.\\nThe parts needed to be specialized are depicted as three dark\\nblocks on the right side of Fig. 2.\\n\\nA User Interface is required for some agents to\\nshow its running state, incoming and outgoing messages,\\nlogging ﬁles, and so on to the human users. The user\\n\\ninterface may differ from agent to agent depending on the\\ntypes of agents. Some are just for monitoring purpose and\\nothers may require menus or buttons for user’s intervention.\\nSophisticated user\\ninterfaces may provide intelligent\\nassistance to users [24]. However, all kinds of user\\ninterfaces can still be quickly built up by using the common\\ncomponents in the Utility package.\\n\\nIn our case study, a number of commercial or self-\\ndeveloped engineering software tools are to be wrapped as\\ncorresponding problem solving agents (PS agent) (details\\ndescribed in Section 4). As a result, the AADE agent model\\nhas an Application Interface and a separate\\nrunning thread for executing and monitoring a certain\\nkind of engineering software tool. The Application\\nInterface needs to be developed one by one according\\nto the requirements of a real engineering project.\\n\\nleast\\n\\nThe Learning/Reasoning/Problem Solving\\nintelligence in.\\nis the place to put an agent’s special\\nAccording to its deﬁnition, an agent is usually a software\\nsystem that enjoys at\\nthe following properties:\\nautonomous, cooperative, reactive, proactive, and ration-\\nality [25]. Each agent has its beliefs, knowledge, desires and\\nintentions. In AADE, we include all the agent functions\\nrelated to knowledge, learning, rule-based reasoning, case-\\nbased reasoning and domain dependant problem solving\\nstrategies in this composite block so that the development of\\nagents could be simpliﬁed by customizing as less\\ncomponents as possible.\\n\\n3.6. Important features\\n\\nThe important features of AADE provide a foundation\\nfor the development of open, dynamic, ﬂexible, and reliable\\n(fault\\ntolerant) multi-agent systems, which are very\\nimportant for real world engineering applications.\\n\\n3.6.1. Multi-threading\\n\\nEach agent deals with multiple threads at the same time\\nto handle concurrent tasks. Fig. 2 shows brieﬂy the threads\\nthat an agent in AADE should have using boxes with dark\\nshadow. As mentioned before, two threads are committing\\nto the socket communication, one thread takes care of\\nexecution of the wrapped external program, while the Main\\nThread and Problem Solving Threads take the\\nroles of periodic scheduling, event-driven scheduling,\\ncoordinating, and domain-dependant tasks’ scheduling.\\n\\n3.6.2. Multi-layered message frame and message handling\\nThe structure of message (messageFrame is used as a\\nterminology in AADE) contains multi-layered information\\nas depicted in Fig. 5. An AADE message envelope is added\\non the standard FIPA envelope to enable advanced\\nmessaging functions. For example, msgLevel is used to\\ndifferentiate the priority level of a message so that urgent\\nmessages in the QInBox and QOutBox could be treated\\ndifferently. Also the Responder could be used to specify\\n\\n\\x0cQ.

With this mechanism, it is possible that\\nmessages are directed to (or pulled by) different threads of\\nan agent. The true multi-threading can only be implemented\\nwith centralized message scheduling being eliminated as\\nmuch as possible.\\n\\nSimilarly, the message handling mechanism involves a\\nmulti-layered architecture. Fig. 6 shows the ﬁve layers of\\nmessage handling in AADE. From bottom to top, they are:\\nnetwork layer, communication layer, message layer,\\nconversation layer and problem solving layer. The reference\\nrelationships of these layers with related data structures are\\nalso shown in Fig. 6 on the right hand side. The good\\npartition of software components demonstrated in AADE\\ncould beneﬁt a feasible, ﬂexible, reliable and maintainable\\nmulti-agent application system.\\n\\n3.6.3.

The communi-\\ncation package is designed to be the internal functionalities\\nof each individual agent rather than having a shared MTS to\\nhandle the intra-agent platform messages. In other words,\\nwe expect the MTS to deal with the cross agent platform\\nmessages only.\\n\\n3.6.4. Originated from and serving to the engineering ﬁelds.\\nSection 4 presents an example of using AADE to develop an\\nagent based collaborative environment for product design\\nand engineering. From this prototype, we could demonstrate\\nthe adaptability of AADE to engineering applications. The\\nagent knowledge base, problem solving abilities, conﬁgur-\\nation ﬁle, registration information, and more specially, the\\ninclusion of an engineering data management agent (EDM\\nagent) could greatly accelerate the development process of\\nengineering multi-agent systems. The related supporting\\nfacilities in Utility package contribute to this feature as\\nwell, such as facilities dealing with engineering ﬁles and ﬁle\\ntransportation (FTP client).\\n\\nBeneﬁting from the object oriented programming and\\ncomponent technologies, AADE provides reusable software\\nlibraries, interfaces and agent development templates that\\ncan be speciﬁed for agent implementation. Development\\ntools that facilitate the development, conﬁguration, debug-\\nging, monitoring and visualization of multi-agent systems\\nare included in our future research and development plan.\\nMore features will be added to the feature list of AADE\\nprogressively.\\n\\n4. A prototype for e-Engineering design\\nand optimization\\n\\nThis section presents our\\n\\nrecent project on the\\ndevelopment of a collaborative product design and\\nengineering environment using agent and Web-based\\ntechnologies. A case study used to validate the prototype\\nenvironment is the design of a wheel-axle assembly (part of\\na bogie system). More information about this project as well\\nas our long-term strategies of e-Engineering services\\nparadigm can be found in [26].\\n\\n4.1. Prototype system architecture\\n\\nThe architecture of this prototype system for engineering\\ndesign and optimization is shown in Fig. 7. It is designed\\nand developed based on AADE. System functions include\\nproject management, job management, user management,\\nengineering data management and system integration with\\ndifferent kinds of engineering software tools. A number of\\nsoftware agents have been designed.\\n\\n\\x0c130\\n\\nQ.

Architecture of an agent based e-engineering design and optimization system.\\n\\n4.1.1. e-Engineering server agent (ES agent)\\n\\nIt is the gateway that users must get through to deﬁne,\\nmanage, and monitor the information about a design project\\nand its afﬁliated design jobs. Therefore, all manipulations of\\nengineering data related to the project, workﬂow, design job\\nand tasks are done by the EDM agent (see below) through\\nthe ES agent. Every time when a design job starts running,\\nthe ES agent generates a job agent dynamically. The reverse\\nprocess happens when the ES detects that a job has been\\nﬁnished.\\n\\n4.1.2. Engineering data management agent (EDM agent)\\n\\nThe EDM agent is a proactive engineering data service\\nagent. EDM has the knowledge of database location,\\nconnection conﬁguration, engineering ﬁle directories, and\\nlocation and conﬁguration of FTP server, etc. It provides\\ndatabase and ﬁle system operation services, such as creating\\n\\ndata sets for a new job, updating design data, retrieving\\ndesign tasks, and helping send data ﬁles proactively to the\\ntarget agents before a job starts.\\n\\n4.1.3. Job agent (JA)\\n\\nA job agent communicates with the EDM agent for\\nstoring and retrieving job data; with the DF agent for\\nsearching matched PS agents; and with the problem solving\\nagents (PS agent) for negotiation based design tasks’\\nallocation. A job agent is created and dissolved dynamically\\nby the ES agent to control the design job it represents.\\n\\n4.1.4. Directory facilitator agent (DF agent)\\n\\nIt has all the registration service functionalities for other\\nagents residing in this multi-agent system; keeps up-to-date\\nagent registration and informs all registered agents with\\n\\n\\x0cQ. Hao et al. / Advanced Engineering Informatics 19 (2005) 123–134\\n\\n131\\n\\nupdated registry; and provides lookup and matching-making\\nservices to job agents.\\n\\n4.1.5. Interface agent (IA)\\n\\nUser requests enter the agent system through the Web-\\nbased user interfaces. Several Servlets are responsible for\\nreceiving these requests on the Web server. The IA then\\ncatches the user requests from Servlets,\\ntranslates the\\nrequests to messages, and initiates corresponding conversa-\\ntions to related agents. On the other hand, when the agent\\nsystem reaches a result, the IA creates updates to user\\ninterfaces based on the replies from agents. So, the IA is a\\nkind of application that functions mainly as a two-way\\nbridge connecting the Web-based user interfaces and the\\nback-end agent systems.\\n\\n4.1.6. Problem solving agent (PS agent)\\n\\nIn this project,\\n\\nPS is the actual engineering problem solving agent. A PS\\nagent not only carries out the communication, negotiation\\nfunctions on behalf of engineering software, but also\\nexecutes the execution thread to do the related analysis,\\nsimulation or optimization based on the parameters\\nprovided by the EDM Agent.\\nfour\\nengineering software tools are wrapped and integrated:\\nIRONCAD v 6.0 (for 3D graphical modeling), DADS v 9.6\\n(for dynamic analysis), ANASYS v 7.1 (for structural\\nanalysis), and AFA (for fatigue analysis). Considering\\nIRONCAD is a standalone interactive 3D modeling soft-\\nware tool which is difﬁcult to execute automatically by the\\nsystem, its representative PS Agent is treated differently as\\nan empty node (shown as a dark circle in Fig. 7). In this\\nspecial case, IRONCAD software must be installed on the\\ndesigner’s local site. Its representing PS agent does not have\\nthe execution interface as other PS agents and the\\nIRONCAD task is manipulated and submitted manually\\nby the human user.\\n\\n4.1.7. Monitoring agent (MA)\\n\\nMA is specially designed to facilitate the monitoring of\\nagents’ behaviors in the multi-agent system. In a distributed\\nmulti-agent system, because information is distributed and\\ncontrolled by each individual agent, it is necessary to have\\nan agent that could accumulate information from various\\nresources when required. Through this monitoring agent,\\ndynamic ‘condition’ of the system, the behavior of this\\nmulti-agent environment as well as all individual agents can\\nbe conveniently monitored or reviewed through a graphical\\ntool provided to the user.\\n\\n4.2. Prototype implementation\\n\\nC/CCC, FORTRAN, and Visual Basic, are also used for\\nlegacy systems integration. All agents are implemented on\\nAADE. The EDM agent\\nis implemented to integrate\\nMySQLe as the primary database for the entire system.\\nServer side modules are implemented on Apachee and\\nTomcate.\\n\\nThe behaviors of agents in AADE can be monitored\\nthrough two kinds of graphical interfaces of the monitoring\\nagent (Fig. 8).\\n\\nFigure 8(a) represents the agent interactions using a\\nsequence-style diagram. Analogous to the UML sequence\\ndiagram, messages between agents are displayed sequen-\\ntially according to their\\ntimes of occurrence. Agent\\ninteraction history can be easily traced from the top to the\\nbottom by scrolling the right-hand scroll bar in the window.\\nInformation of messages and conversations are also\\nassociated with the graph for the convenience of monitor-\\ning. Another style of interface in Fig. 8(b) shows message\\ninteractions among agents as directed arrows. This interface\\nis a dynamical one with only the current message is\\nhighlighted.\\n\\nSimple agent conﬁguration tool is implemented for the\\nagent construction process in AADE. However, advanced\\nagent construction, monitoring and development tools are\\ncurrently not available yet.\\n\\nA working prototype based on AADE is developed\\nthrough several agent interaction scenarios. More detailed\\ndescription about this prototype implementation could be\\nfound in [27]. Fig. 9 shows some screenshots of the\\ndeveloped prototype.\\n\\nFigure 9(a) is a project deﬁnition user interface. A ‘project\\nmanager’ can deﬁne the workﬂow of a design project\\n(including its composed tasks, control points and their\\nrelationships) by specifying a predeﬁned project workﬂow\\ntemplate. The purpose of deﬁning the workﬂow-based\\nproject\\nis to streamline heterogeneous activities in a\\nmultidisciplinary team so that distributed team members\\ncould collaborate on a project in an integrated environment.\\nFor legacy systems’ wrapping, we already developed a\\nparametric interface built in IRONCAD using Visual Basic.\\nBecause IRONCAD does not provide parametric modeling\\nfunctions, this interface supports the backend CAD modeler\\nto complete parameter change over the wheel-axle CAD\\nmodel. Our prototype system also provides a Web-based\\nuser interface for inputting similar parameters in the job\\ndeﬁnition of a project.

is strongly affected by the choiceof the basis function dilation.\\', \\'the paper presents twoalgorithms.\\', \\'the ﬁrst one allows the network to adapt todilation.\\', \\'because the dilation enters into reconstructionof the function in a non-linear fashion, a lyapunovstability proof requires the imposition of hard con-straints on the adapted parameters.\\', \\'for a function witha known optimal dilation, convergence was demon-strated, but the actual speed of dilation adaptation wasnecessarily slow.\\', \\'since the use of a single dilation maynot be optimal for any given function,

stability isbetter guaranteed.\\', \\'the ﬁrst bases the adaptation of themulti-resolution network coefﬁcients on a separate errorfor each layer of the network, and the second adapts bymeans of an overall prediction error.\\', \\'the latterapproach has the advantage that the lyapunov stabilityproof does not require imposition of hard constraints onthe coefﬁcients.\\', \\'however, using the overall erroralso slows down the adaptation process as comparedto the adaptation process based on the error at eachlayer.the neural networks that involve back propagation,recurrent or radial basis functions often result in longtraining time,local minima and lack of self-tuningability in on-line applications.\\', \\'due to these reasons, yeet al.(1998) adopted a bayesian–gaussian neuralnetwork (bgnn) for predicting dynamic behavior ofa non-linear single-input single-output system and forpredicting the static performance and dynamic behaviorof circulating ﬂuidized bed boilers.\\', \\'a comparison of theperformance of bayesian–gaussian bgnn versusbpnn in terms of both the static performance anddynamic behavior predictions of the two circulatingﬂuidized bed (cfb) boilers is given in the paper.\\', \\'on thepositive side, bgnn gives reasonably good predictionsand takes less training time than the bpnn.\\', \\'on thenegative side, bgnn requires longer execution timethan the bpnn does, possibly due to the large topologyof bgnn.\\', \\'one disadvantage of bgnn is that problemscan occur when the training data set is large, becausethis network stores all the training data into its topologyfrom the beginning.\\', \\'by contrast, the bpnns ‘compress’the training data set into the connection weights andthresholds.\\', \\'when new training data are introduced, thetopology of the bgnn does not grow because of its self-tuning ability.\\', \\'on the other hand, when new samples areavailable to retrain the bpnns, they must be carefullyscreened to select the ones that contain innovativeinformation.\\', \\'if a large amount of new samples contain-ing little innovative information were used in retraining,the new samples may overwhelm the existing ones thatare smaller in

controlling an environmentalprocess involves a number of subprocesses that need tobe managed or automated.\\', \\'for example, in a pollution–mitigation–plant environment, there are several levels atwhich to address the problem of management andcontrol.\\', \\'at the lowest level, there are instruments thatmonitor, sense, and manipulate process variables.\\', \\'theinstruments are often connected to a control structurethat is capable of implementing a control law.\\', \\'the nextlevel is the supervisory host computer that is usuallyconnected to some control hardware by

may in turn be connected toa plant-wide and then the corporate-wide computersystems (rynk, 1992).in the most general terms, ai is the use of computersto emulate the reasoning and decision-making processesof humans (walker, 1993).\\', \\'there are many opportu-nities for applying ai and expert systems into processcontrol and management.\\', \\'these opportunities are mostoften realized by implementing functionality on thesupervisory host computer, and can include applicationssuch as computer-aided instruction and training, main-tenance, conﬁguration, plant planning and optimiza-tion, scheduling, alarm management, and operatordecision supportstudies onapplication of ai to the process industries involve thetechnologies of expert systems, fuzzy logic, and neuralnetworks.(stock, 1989).\\', \\'mostexpert systems can emulate human problem solvingby representing the expertise in its knowledge base.\\', \\'anexpert system usually consists of three major compo-nents: a knowledge base, an inference engine, and aworking memory.\\', \\'the knowledge base contains factsand heuristics associated with the application domain.the inference engine searches the knowledge base forapplicable rules, and applies the rules for solving theproblem.\\', \\'the working memory is the repository to storethe new information generated as the inference enginesearches and selects rules.\\', \\'in addition to the threecomponents, an expert system typically contains othercomponents such as a user interface and explanationfacility.fuzzy logic has emerged as an alternative to classicalor binary valued logic in application areas ranging fromindustrial process controlto consumer products toaerospace and bioengineering (langari and yen,1995).\\', \\'the role that fuzzy logic plays in the diverseapplications is to bridge the gap between symbolicprocessing and numerical computation in shaping asuitable rule-based and linguistic control strategy.\\', \\'inbridging the gap, fuzzy logic has expanded the domainof application of control engineering to those that havetraditionally fallen outside its realm if a strictly binaryvalued logic has been applied.\\', \\'hence, fuzzy logic formsthe basis for implementation of control strategies in the‘‘wide sense’’ to enable decision-making or supervisorycontrol.\\', \\'the major distinctions between ‘‘fuzzy logic’’and ‘‘expert systems’’ are the use of linguistic ratherthan numeric variables, and the use of fuzzy conditionalstatements rather than exact expressions.\\', \\'rules thatincorporate linguistic and inexact data can be manipu-lated as a useful tool for reasoning about difﬁcultprocess management and control situations (walker,1993).neural networks are a computational paradigmmodeled on the human brain.\\', \\'the three importantsimilarities to the brain’s capabilities are the ability toﬁlter out essential data from a larger set of datacontaining irrelevant information, the ability to learnfrom experience, and the ability to generalize fromprevious experience to predict new outcomes (walker,1993).\\', \\'an artiﬁcial neural network (ann) modelismade of input and output connections, which simulatesthe human

of an expert system to helpcontrol and manage a composting process was explored.an expert system-assisted computer control programwas developed for an ‘‘aerated static pile’’ compostingsystem,

undesirable overdraftof the ground-water basin, (iv) analyze the impact ofhydraulic and other characteristics of ground water, and(v) maximize the beneﬁts of the available resources.\\', \\'dueto the complexity of the problem, a single-objectiveapproach is insufﬁcient to address the inter-relationshipsamong these issues, and a multi-criteria technique isadopted.\\', \\'to supportthis difﬁcult

completeback-propagation algorithm.\\', \\'sometimes a momentumterm is adapted to a modiﬁed gradient rule so thatoscillation is avoided in the convergence process (reichet al., 1999).\\', \\'applications of back-propagation neuralnetwork (bpnn) can be found in bhat and mcavoy(1990), de veaux et al.\\', \\'(1999), melas et al.\\', \\'(2000), andreich et al.\\', \\'(1999).kavchak and budman (1999) used another type offunction.\\', \\'theneural networks called radial basisaccuracy of a model is strongly affected by the choiceof the basis function dilation.\\', \\'the paper presents twoalgorithms.\\', \\'the ﬁrst one allows the network to adapt todilation.\\', \\'because the dilation enters into reconstructionof the function in a non-linear fashion, a lyapunovstability proof requires the imposition of hard con-straints on the adapted parameters.\\', \\'for a function witha known optimal dilation, convergence was demon-strated, but the actual speed of dilation adaptation wasnecessarily slow.\\', \\'since the use of a single dilation maynot be optimal for any given function, the secondalgorithm with a different strategy was proposed.\\', \\'it usesa multi-resolution neural network representation.\\', \\'thisstructure uses a collection of wavelets of differentdilations, which allows the estimator to account formultiple dominant frequencies in the function beingestimated.\\', \\'two sets of adaptation laws were proposedfor this multi-resolution network, for which stability isbetter guaranteed.\\', \\'the ﬁrst bases the adaptation of themulti-resolution network coefﬁcients on a separate errorfor each layer of the network, and the second adapts bymeans of an overall prediction error.\\', \\'the latterapproach has the advantage that the lyapunov stabilityproof does not require imposition of hard constraints onthe coefﬁcients.\\', \\'however, using the overall erroralso slows down the adaptation process as comparedto the adaptation process based on the error at eachlayer.the neural networks that involve back propagation,recurrent or radial basis functions often result in longtraining time,local minima and lack of self-tuningability in on-line applications.\\', \\'due to these reasons, yeet al.(1998) adopted a bayesian–gaussian neuralnetwork (bgnn) for predicting dynamic behavior ofa non-linear single-input single-output system and forpredicting the static performance and dynamic behaviorof circulating ﬂuidized bed boilers.\\', \\'a comparison of theperformance of bayesian–gaussian bgnn versusbpnn in terms of both the static

training time than the bpnn.\\', \\'on thenegative side, bgnn requires longer execution timethan the bpnn does, possibly due to the large topologyof bgnn.\\', \\'one disadvantage of bgnn is that problemscan occur when the training data set is large, becausethis network stores all the training data into its topologyfrom the beginning.\\', \\'by contrast, the bpnns ‘compress’the training data set into the connection weights andthresholds.\\', \\'when new training data are introduced, thetopology of the bgnn does not grow because of its self-tuning ability.\\', \\'on the other hand, when new samples areavailable to retrain the bpnns, they must be carefullyscreened to select the ones that contain innovativeinformation.\\', \\'if a large amount of new samples contain-ing little innovative information were used in retraining,the new samples may overwhelm the existing ones thatare smaller in number but which represent crucialcharacteristics of some aspects of the process, therebyattenuating prediction ability of these networks.neural networks have been frequently applied forenvironmental process modeling and control.\\', \\'melaset al.\\', \\'(2000) presented a bpnn

machine-learning pat-tern-classiﬁcation algorithms in new application areas.the purpose of a pattern classiﬁer is to assign everyinput pattern to one of a small number of discreteclasses or groups.\\', \\'there are three major approaches todeveloping pattern classiﬁers: the probability-density-function (pdf), posterior-probability, and boundary-forming strategies.the ﬁve most common types of neural networkclassiﬁers are pdf, global and local neural network,nearest neighbor and rule forming.\\', \\'pdf classiﬁersprovide good performance when the pdf of the inputfeatures are known and when there is sufﬁcient trainingdata.\\', \\'global and local neural network classiﬁers areboth suitable for applications in which probabilisticoutputs are desired.\\', \\'nearest-neighbor classiﬁers are bestsuited for problems in which fast training and adapta-tion are essential.\\', \\'finally, rule-based classiﬁers anddecision trees are most suitable when a minimal-sizedclassiﬁer is desired and when simple explanations forclassiﬁer decisions are desired.lnknet integrates all of these methods.\\', \\'the softwarecan be used at any of the three levels described asfollows.\\', \\'the point-and-click graphical user interface canfacilitate rapid experimentation and interaction with thevarious classiﬁers on new databases.\\', \\'users who want toexecute long batch jobs can edit and run the shell scriptsproduced by the point-and-click interface.\\', \\'finally, userswith knowledge of c programming can work at thesource-code level.\\', \\'atthis level, c source code oflnknet can be embedded in a user applicationprogram.\\', \\'lnknet contains more than 20 neural net-work, pattern-classiﬁcation, and feature-selection algo-rithms.\\', \\'the algorithms can be trained and tested onseparate data or tested with automatic cross-validation.the software is written in c and runs under the unixoperating system.\\', \\'a number of research laboratoriesincluding the lincoln laboratory of massachussettesinstitute of technology have used lnknet successfullyfor many diverse applications, including talker identiﬁ-cation, talker–gender classiﬁcation, hand-printed char-acter recognition, underwater and environmental soundclassiﬁcation, image spotting, seismic-signal classiﬁca-tion, medical diagnosis, galaxy classiﬁcation, and faultdetection.more recently, rodrigo et al.\\', \\'(1999) described a fuzzyproportion-integral-differential (pid) controller for anon-linear sludge aeration process developed based onexpert knowledge.\\', \\'the controller incorporated fuzzyneural networks that were applied to modify the fuzzyfunctions and fuzzy rules in the controllers.\\', \\'molina et al.(2000) used expert systems and neural networks toconstruct a predictive maintenance system for a hydro-electric power plant.\\', \\'the expert system was built basedon a rule-based diagnostic model, and a neural networkpredictive model was developed based on historical datato produce process predictions.neural network models are often considered ‘blackboxes’ due to their inability to provide explanations.\\', \\'tocompensate for this weakness, de veaux et al.\\', \\'(1999)proposed a hybrid system of neural network and ﬁrstprinciple differential equation.\\', \\'this combination issometimes called a ‘grey box’.\\', \\'the inclusion of ﬁrstprinciple

multi-component, multi-phase, multi-period, andmulti-criterion characteristics.\\', \\'the goalis to obtaindesired environmental targets with minimized capitaland operating costs.\\', \\'however,the possibility foraccomplishing this goal could be affected by manyconstraints, limitations and complexities that exist in thepollution control systems.\\', \\'facing these challenges, it isessential to identify effective approaches for realizing thedesired targets.\\', \\'in the following, the detailed perspec-tives will be discussed.(1) data availability: the insufﬁciency of informationabout pollution sources, minimization and mitigationmeasures, water quality records and economic dataoften hinder the development of effective models orexpert systems.\\', \\'in many situations,information ofscaled and ﬁeld works was insufﬁcient for supportingthe ai-aided process modeling and control studies.thus, researchers have to work within limited scopeswhere the required data are available, constraining theadoption oftechniques of comprehensive analysis,integrated modeling, global optimization, and systema-tic consideration.\\', \\'it is suggested that improvement indata availability and quality is pre-requisite for usefulprocess control studies.(2) data reliability: many environmental data aresubject to signiﬁcant problems of uncertainties, incon-sistencies, and errors.\\', \\'in fact, reliability and uncertaintyc88c.w.\\', \\'chan, g.h.\\', \\'huang / engineering applications of artiﬁcial intelligence 16 (2003) 75–90are direct opposites of each other.\\', \\'thatis, highreliability usually corresponds to low uncertainty, butit is, in fact, difﬁcult to achieve both high reliability andlow uncertainty at the same time.\\', \\'however, it is wellrecognized that high uncertainty means high systemcomplexity, and low reliability could be worse than nodata.\\', \\'to obtain improved reliability and certainty, solidworks on validation of input data before they are usedfor further ai-related studies are desired.(3) validity of methodology: a variety of techniqueshave been developed forsupporting missions ofenvironmental process management and control.\\', \\'how-ever, problems of reliability and suitability exist.\\', \\'inprocess simulation and prediction, due to the existenceof uncertainties and the lack of quantiﬁed economicinformation, most of neural network models can onlyreﬂect part of the impact factors.\\', \\'these affect accuracyofthe prediction.\\', \\'therefore, when neural networkmodels are used for providing decision support, theresearchers have to conduct solid on-site works to gainas much insight of the study system as the processmanagers before claiming that they are wiser and can dobetter jobs.\\', \\'simply staying in ofﬁces and conductingmodeling computations and theoreticalimaginationsbased on documented reports and data will notwork.(4) system complexity: environmental processes gen-erally have interactive, dynamic and uncertain features.complexities exist in determination of system para-meters, reﬂection of interactive relationships, formula-tion of ai-aided modeling approaches, interpretation ofresearch outputs, and implementation of recommendedactivities.\\', \\'often, to quantify and control such systems, anumber of simpliﬁcations were made by adopting, forexample linear, continuous, static, and/or deterministicassumptions.\\', \\'these simpliﬁcations, however, are subjectto risks of system errors and failures.\\', \\'how to effectivelyreﬂect these complexities without taking these risks hasbeen a challenging question facing the modelingresearchers.\\', \\'obviously, using any single technique tosolve such problems could be subject to risks.\\', \\'therefore,whenever possible,recommended to use anintegration of more than one tool to tackle differentaspects of these complexities.\\', \\'this paper has presentedsome hybrid approachesincorporate diversetechniques.\\', \\'these can be more ﬂexibly adopted toaddress more open-ended investigations.\\', \\'for example,the ann technique can be integrated with fuzzy logic totackle more complex problems.\\', \\'the ability of fuzzy logicto model qualitative knowledge and represent knowl-edge in a logical form can compensate for the weaknessin ann of embedding knowledge implicitly in theirstructural parameters (zhou, 2002).\\', \\'applications of thehybrid approachesto pollution minimization andmitigation processes would be a fruitful direction offuture research.thatisit8.\\', \\'conclusionsseveral demanding areasfor enhanced researchefforts are discussed, including issues of data availabilityand reliability, methodology validity, and system com-plexity.\\', \\'in general, expert systems and ai techniques canbe categorized according to problem solving or tasktypes.\\', \\'along this dimension,the majority of aiapplications for pollution mitigation and minimizationfall into four broad task groups: (i) process control, (ii)prediction or estimation,(iii) process modeling orsimulation, and (iv) process management that involvessome comparison and evaluation of cost–beneﬁt ratiosof different solution scenarios.\\', \\'among these, the mostfrequently tackled tasks are process control, prescrip-tion, and prediction.\\', \\'when sufﬁcient data are available,the neural network technique often generates goodresults for system prediction.\\', \\'on the other hand, expertsystems are often used for the task of prescription andcontrol which involve process modeling and optimiza-tion.\\', \\'however, many environmental processes arecomplex with interactive, dynamic and uncertain fea-tures, leading to difﬁculties in using a single technique tosolve such problems.\\', \\'therefore, integrated or hybridapproaches are desired for reﬂecting such complexitiesand accomplishing the desired targets.problems of environmental pollution have causedsevere stress on the human society and economicprogress.\\', \\'pollution abatementthrough minimiza-tion and mitigation measures is an important approachfor addressing such a challenge, whereeffectiveprocess control would be essentialfor obtainingdesired efﬁciencies.\\', \\'recently, ai technologies have beenfound to excelin environmental systems that arecomplex, non-linear, and uncertain.\\', \\'this
