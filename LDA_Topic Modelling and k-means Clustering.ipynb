andwritingthis  paper  argues  that  m  medical  writing,  and  probably  in  many  scientificdisciplines, the representation  of truth is highly formalized  three types of  truthare at stake, and the options for  referring to them are restricted by conventions,statistical conventions in the case of evidential truth, and  lexical conventions inthe  case  of  other  truth-types  these  lexical  conventions  are  drawn  from  thestandard  commentative  repertoire  in  the  language  which  permits  writers  todraw  attention  to  the  truth  or  value  of what  they  saycontext,  evidence,  and  interpretation  and  their  realizations  through  thecommentative  system  are  at  the  heart  of  scientific  writing  an  understandingof this system is useful  at three levels  firstly, it can be of some direct  assistancein  training  people  how  to  write,  though  one  should  be  careful  here  not  tooverstate  the  value  language  has  for journal  editors, whose  line  is likely  to  bethat  it is science that counts, and  that  bad  wnting can  usually be rescued  if  thescientific  quality  makes  the  effort  worthwhile  secondly,  it  is  of  indirectassistance  to  anyone  involved  in  writing  academic  language  or  teachingabout  it, as a means of providing insight not only into the surface  phenomena,b\\\\\\'ut into  the  reasoning  that  shapes  them  and  thirdly,  it is of  value  for  criticalreadingthis  last  is  a  relatively  uncontentious  matter  such  concepts  as  movestructure  analysis,  or  functional  analysis  in  general,  or  the  representation  oftruth,  offer  lines  of  attack  for  making  sense  of  a  kind  of  wnting  whichnewcomers  may  perceive  as  mannered  and  obscure  they  create  therefore  thepossibility  of  a  kind  of  discussion  which  successfully  complements thatexemplified  in jones  and  kinmonth  (1994),  though  the  extent  to which  this  ispossible  is  a  function  of  the  sophistication  of  the  learner  and  the  relevantconcepts  may  be  taught,  and  successfully  used  by,  native  and  non-nativespeakers  alikethe question of teaching wnting raises some important  points, however  thedifficulties  of this kind of approach  here are well brought out by  dudley-evans(1995) in the context of a discussion  on genre analysis in general  an attempt  tosystematize  wnting  gives—or  may  give—an  impression  of  prescnptivism,  sothat  a teacher may appear to say that, for  example, \\\\\\'contextual  truth  should  beused  in  the introductory  section\\\\\\'  the  creation  in  the classroom  of a  prescnp-uve mindset  subverts  the  whole  point  of  this  style of  teaching,  replacing  whatought  to be a tool for reflection, enquiry, and  understanding by a set of  surfacerules which may be mechanically applied  far from  it being the case that  \\\\\\'good\\\\\\'wnting must deploy the range of resources descnbed here in the way that i haveconsidered

explicit set of constraints on thepresentation of research  in medical journals  these are set out in a key paper inthe bmj  (1991), which  carries  the imprimatur  of  the international  committeeof

thecommentative  potential  which  is available  to  medical  wntersto  a  large extent—though  not  exclusively—this  is a question  of  how  doubtand  certainty  are  expressed  the  fact  that  scientific  wnting  refers  to  differentlevels of certainty is studied in detail by latour  and woolgar (1986  75 ff), whoconsider  5 \\\\\\'statement  types\\\\\\' which  appear  in  formal  and

thatthe  thrust  of  the  paper  is to  argue,  contrary  to  at  least  some  of  the  evidence,that  for  asian  female  patients  in  the  uk,  ethnic  origin  is  a  more  importantfactor  in choice of doctor than gender  the preliminary reading, whose  findingsare  themselves  sometimes  contradictory,  is  quoted  ambiguously in  otherwords  it  is set  up  only  in order  that  it  may

technical  meaning,  whose  function  is  to  comment  on  propositions  byoffering  a  measurement  of  strength  of  claim—with  the  proviso  that  thetechnical  meanings  may  be used  to  manufacture  inscrutabilitythe  way  that  pressure  on  journal  space  compresses  contextual  truth  isperceived  as  a  senous  problem  the  conventions  are  such  that  the  sharedinformation  which  is  to  inform  the  study  must  be  sketched  very  quicklyjournal  space  does  not  permit  detailed  analysis  of  individual  papers,  nor  is itencouraged  (see  the  remarks  from  the  international  committee  of  medicaljournal  editors above), nor  are all relevant  studies  necessarily  identified  in theliterature search  the shorthand  of  the  review removes  the elaborate  system  ofchecks  and  balances  which  are  involved  in  the  truth-claims  made,  and  whichhave  rendered  it  necessary  to  present  information  discursively  rather  thannumerically  in  the  first  place  the  risk  that  studies  will  therefore  be  falsifiedover  a  period  of  time as  they  are  quoted  and  requoted  is also  well-knownthis is the picture for particular  articles  at a higher level, when the questionis what  is known  to be true  in a particular field, the sheer  volume of  literature,the constraints  which  mean  that  much  of it is underreported  (chalmers  1990),and  the fact  that  most  health  care interventions  have  moderate effects  anywaycompared  to  non-intervention  make  it  almost  impossible  for  researcher  orldownoaded fromh

of  the  reasonsbehind the development  of what is known  as evidence based medicine (ebm),which  is associated  with a procedure  (and  wntten  genre) called  the  \\\\\\'systematicreview\\\\\\'  (for  details  see  e g  mulrow  1987,  1994,  dickcrsin,  scherer,  andlefebvre  1994  for  details  of  ebm  in  general,  see  evidence-based  medicineworking  group  1992)  the  function  of  systematic  reviews  is to  assess  know-ledge  by  reviewing  literature  according  to  well-defined  principles  it  seemsprobable,  therefore,  that  one  consequence  of  systematic  reviews  will  be  thedevelopment  of  well-defined,  different  conventions  for  contextual  truth,  asecond-order  truth  supervening  on  the  truths  of  individual  studies, and  this  isa developing  field  which  will  repay  study3 3  evidential  truthevidential  truth  is  the  most  apparently  scientific  of  truth  types definition  unambiguous  (if it were  ambiguous, it  would  not  be  evidential)it  is  bycontextual  truth  sets out  those areas deemed  to be true and common  groundbetween writer and  reader for the purposes of a particular study, though it doesso in an ambiguous manner  evidential truth  sets forward  things declared to  betrue as the result of the study in question  contextual  truth,  that  is, defines  thegiven, evidential  truth  defines  the  newevidential  truth  springs  from  the  results section  of the research  article,  andis  associated  with  a  very  small  set  of  technical  terms,  of  which  the  mostenlightening,  the  word  significant,  has  already  been  mentioned  the  ordinarylanguage  meaning  of  this word  is value-laden  one  thinks  of  significance  as  asubjective  matter  in  scientific writing, it is the most well-defined,  and  the mostobjective,  of  comments  a  proposition  is  \\\\\\'significant\\\\\\'  if  the  conventions  ofstatistics  declare  it  to  be  there  are  two  other  common  terms, association  and(less frequently)  relation,  as  for  example  the  followingthese changes were related to increases in rate (p <0 01)both  anger  and  excitement  were associated with a  greater  rate  of  contractions(whorwell et al  lancet 1992  71-2)evidential  truth  therefore  provides  good  evidence  that  truth  in  academicmedicine  is becoming  a  matter  of  conventionit is the apparent  function  of the  results section in medical writing to presentfigures, to assert  significant  patterns, and  to talk about  the figures without pre-empting  the  sort  of  truth  associated  with  the  discussion  section (note,however,  that  thompson  (1993)  found  examples  of  a  commentary  on  resultsin a study of biochemistry papers ) this is often  a matter of elucidating complexvisual  displays,  or  of  drawing  the  reader\\\\\\'s  attention  to  matters  of  interestwithout  specifically  offering  them a  term  so value-laden  as interesting  (skelton1994)the commentative  labels which characterize  the figures identified  by eviden-tial truth  may fall  into one  of two categories  firstly, they may be  well-definedldownoaded fromh

theword  significant  or  the  phrase  is  associated  with  variations  which  are  notsufficiently  different  to  attract  one  of  these  phrases  accrue  their  own  technicalvocabulary,  and  this  in  turn  may  be offered  a numerical  definition,  for  examplethe  effect  of  phase  of  treatment  is negligible  (p = 0  88)the  distribution  by  cause  of  all  deaths  was  similar  for  the  two  treatment  groupsthere was very little difference  between  the treatments for early reactions and none  forlate  reactions  by  cox\\\\\\'s  proportional  hazards  model  (unadjusted  for

85  (0 39  to  1 89)  (ernngton  et  al  bmj  1991  1047-48)secondly,  the  comments  may  be  gradable  adjectives  such  as  big,  small  etc  usedwith  internal  reference  only—that  is, one  quoted  figure  may  be judged  as  biggerthan  another,  but  will  not  be  judged  as  big,  in  some  real-world  sense,  beyondthe  table  in  which  it  existspatients from  the western  isles

this  difference  isrelevant  (or  statistically  significant)beyond the  results  section,  matters  become  more  complex  claims  forevidential  truth  may  appear  in  the  discussion,  realized  by  a  small  set  ofterms  involved  with  making  a  claim  on  behalf  of  the  research  these  termsare  most  frequently  shows  and  demonstrates, as  inthe  concept  of  \"accidental

(sellar  et  al  bmj  1991  19)the  proposition  that  accidents are not  random—note that  the evidential  claim  isbacked  by  explicit  reference  to  the  terminology  of  statistics—is  confirmed  bythe  comment  shows  the  evidential  nature  of  shows—it is  a  comment  on  whatstatistical  findings  say  rather  than  how  the  world  is—is  well-illustrated  in  thefollowing,  which  is

leadingdiagnoses suggests that the test is quite widely accepted  this acceptance is confirmedby the high confidence in these diagnoses after imaging (115  of  169  scored 9/10 or 10/10 confident)  (dixon et al  bmj  1991  81)dixon  et  al  have  questionnaire-based  evidence  that  magnetic  resonanceimaging  influences  leading  diagnoses  this  therefore  becomes,  in  their  terms,a fact  it would  seem  to  follow  that  doctors  have  confidence  in  the  techniquethis  is confirmed  by  a  further,  direct  question  on  confidence  levels  this  too,therefore,  becomes a  fact  it is interesting  to note  in this respect  that show andconfirm often  appear,  as here, in present  tense form  find,  apparently, is alwayspast  where  the  form  is showed it  typically  appears  in  the  results  section  (seehunston  1994 on  the importance  of tenses)  it is now  the explicit policy of  thebrit j  of  gen  prac  (personal  communication)  to restrict  the  results  section  tothe past  tensedixon et al  offer  a brief hypothesis (the technique is well-accepted), and  theresponse  to  a  single  question  is  enough  to  confirm  it  other  hypotheses  aremuch  bigger, however,  and  here single pieces of evidence  only  have  the  powerto support  and  suggest  they cannot confirm  though  an  evidential claim  maybe  made,  the  hypothetical  proposition  to  which  it  refers  is  too  complex  tobecome  \\\\\\'true\\\\\\' just  by  virtue  of  itoverall,  these findings support  the hypothesis  that kaposi\\\\\\'s  sarcoma  is caused  by atransmissible

and that it is not prevalent among britishheterosexuals except those with sexual contacts from  africa  (beral et al  bmj 1991625)the question  here  is whether  the claim  made  for  the proposition  is that  it  hasevidential or interpretative  status  given the complexity of many clinical areas,and  the  minor  shifts  in  health  outcome  associated  with  changes  in  treatment,modesty of claim is typically appropnate  the issue in this particular example isone of  pitching  a claim  at  an  appropriately  acceptable  level, of weighing  clearevidence  against  complex  hypothesis  but  the  distinction  between  commentslike show  and  those  like  suggest  may  be  indicative  of  other  issues  there  is  astandard  problem  in logic at  stake, that of whether  a statement  can  go  beyonditself  to  give information  about  the  world,  or  whether  the  truth  it  propoundsmust be tautological  versions of  this opposition  are often  dealt with  using  thekantian

drivers  on  this line of  reasoning,  theonly  valid  inference  is a  tautologythe argument  here is exceptionally  complex, and  i shall not  attempt  to  takeit further  but it is fairly  clear  that  to make a claim which is not tautological  isto  make  a  truth-claim  of  a  different  kind,  and  it  is possible  that  the  differentstrengths  of  claim  in  the  contrast  between  comments  like  show  and  suggestreflect  differing  degrees  of  sensitivity  to  thisthere is one  further  point  here which  concerns  the issue of significance  forthe  researcher,  \\\\\\'significance\\\\\\'  is  a  matter  of  statistics  but  for  the  medicalpractitioner  it  is  rather  a  matter  of  clinical  importance,  as  in  this  examplefrom  a  study  of  the  perceived  significance  of  clinical  signs  of  hypertension  inpregnancyof the respondents 93% considered  oedema a useful  indicator  and 49% would useankle oedema in thetr assessment  however, 70% considered generalized oedema tobe more significant  (bisson et at  brit j of gen prac 1991  23)this distinction  between  statistical  and  clinical  significance is  well-established,but  it  is  only  recently  that,  for  example,  the-brit  j  of  gen  prac  (personalcommunication) have taken  the formal  decision  to exclude the latter use of  theword  from  results sections, to avoid  the possibility of confusion  the  problemcan  be  avoided  by  distinguishing  between  statistical  significance  and  clinicalrelevance,  as  in the  following—the  contrast  is between  the complex  picture  ofcerebrovascular  and  other  complications  in  two  groups  of  patients,  onereceiving  a particular  course  of  treatment,  the  other  notthe differences  were not significant  and, more importantly, they did not seem to beclinically relevant  (maggiom et at  bmj  1991  1431)what  underpins  this  sometimes  ambiguous  usage  is  perhaps  a  sense  thatmedicine  differs  from  other  sciences in  the  immediacy  of  its involvement  withmatters  of  human  welfare  alongside  the  randomized  controlled  trials  whichare  the  stock-in-trade  of  medical  research  and  the  major  journals,  there  existother  traditions,  asserting  their  own  importance,  their  own  claim  to  meancase-study  reports of particular  patients,  for  example, still find space in  majorjournals and are regarded seriously  similarly, the bmj  runs a section  presentlytitled  \\\\\\'personal  view\\\\\\',  which  welcomes  personal,  occasionally  very  moving,anecdotes  there  is  generally  a  very  strong  tradition  of  narrative  in  medicalwriting,  which  dates  back  both  to  the  anecdotal  approach  of  medical  journalwriting up to the turn  of the century (very roughly—there are still traces of it inthe  1950s), and  more  specifically  in  psychiatry  to  the  legacy  of  the  freudiancase  history  (see also e g  sacks  1985, and  comments  by

interpretation  of  what  thefigures mean  there is an additional point here, which is that drawing  attentionto  one  particular  figure  from  a  mass  of  data  in  the  results  section,  howeverneutrally  this is done,  is to  assign  it importance  while competing  figures  whichare  not  discussed  are  tacitly  recognized  as  trivial  (or,  less  honourably,  areshuffled  off-stage  because  they  run  counter  to  the writer\\\\\\'s  hypothesis)the  impetus  of  the  scientific  paper  is,  it  was  suggested,  typically  from  theknown, to the new, to a recontextuahzation  of the new in the secondary  reviewand  it  moves  finally  to  speculation  about  what  the  new  information  means(berkenkotter  and  huckin  1995  argue  persuasively  for

speculationcreates  a  new  truth,  a  tentative  and  provisional  truth  of  interpretations  andpossibilities,  and  it is a major  function  of  the  discussion  section  to  sketch  outthose  possibilitiesinterpretations  are of two types, which i shall call interpretative labelling andspeculation  the first of these is the decision  to  label a particular  finding,  set offindings,  or  indeed  the  whole  study,  as  being  in  some  (non-statistical)  sense\\\\\\'important\\\\\\',  or  as  having  a  particular  value  the  second  involves  speculationabout what the main findings mean (though the definition  of\\\\\\'mean\\\\\\'  may vary)interpretative  labelling  involves  judgements  about  value,  and  speculationinvolves judgements  of fact  in some cases, there is a degree of overlap  betweenthem  interpretative  labelling  may  be  quite  anodyne  in  force,  or  it  may  be  aclaim for substantial meaning  if it is in the former,  it is often  to be found  in theresults  section,  and  is  associated  either  with  gradable  adjectives  or  withintensifiers/deintensifiers,  or  both it  may  function  as  a  way  of  drawingattention  to  figures  which,  though  different  from  each  other,  are  not  statisti-cally significant  an unusually explicit example of this is bedanda et al  (1993),who  sayalthough our sample is too small to draw any definite conclusion it is interesting thatthe  3 subjects  who  had  detectable  antinuclear  antibodies  with  speckled  pattern  offluorescence  were among the lowest responders (bedanda et al

compared  to a control group  the difference,  however, istoo  small  for  significance  therefore  nothing  evidentially,  and  very  littleinterpretatively,  depends  on  it  they  later  offer  a
