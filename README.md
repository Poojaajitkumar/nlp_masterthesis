Assessing study selection using NLP techniques: 

The extracted data is then pre-processed using NLTK  
The processed data is then sent to a clustering algorithms. Similar set of documents is clustered here. The top terms of each cluster is then considered to select the relevant research/data for further assessment.   
Another such method which is considered to select the most relevant research is LDA. LDA helps in discovering abstract "topics" that occur in the collection of documents  
The topics are then studied and the documents which are most relevant to topic of interest is then selected for further assessment.
