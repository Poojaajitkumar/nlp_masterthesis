Hao et al. / Advanced Engineering Informatics 19 (2005) 123–134\\n\\nreview of projects related to conceptual design could be\\nfound in [1,7].\\n\\nDuring the past several years, we have been working on\\nthe development of collaborative environments for multi-\\ndisciplinary design optimization (MDO) and developed a\\nprototype software environment-WebBlow (a Web/agent\\nbased blow molded parts design and optimization environ-\\nment) [8–10]. In WebBlow, a multi-agent system is used to\\nintegrate blow molding process simulation, performance\\nsimulation and optimization algorithms.\\n\\nHowever, the development of an agent based industrial\\napplication is not an easy task. In building an agent based\\napplication, developers unavoidably meet the challenge of\\ninsufﬁcient support of agent level infrastructures. On the\\nother hand, in spite of the technical difﬁculties in developing\\nmulti-agent systems, the interoperability between hetero-\\ngeneous agents and agent systems is also very important. If\\none system does not interoperate with others, the general\\napplicability of the system in the engineering ﬁelds cannot\\nbe assured.\\n\\nFor the above reasons, the major objective of Foundation of\\nIntelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) [11] has been targeted to\\npromote the interoperability of heterogeneous agents and\\nagent systems. Moreover, with the mature of FIPA speciﬁca-\\ntions and the proliferation of FIPA compliant agent platforms\\nand toolkits,\\ntechnologies in\\nindustries are promisingly foreseeable. However, no one\\nexisting FIPA compliant agent platform or toolkit can easily\\nbe applied to develop engineering applications.\\n\\nthe applications of agent\\n\\nBased on comprehensive studies on FIPA speciﬁcations,\\nagent platforms, and agent applications, as well as more\\nthan ten years experience on the development of agent based\\nengineering design and manufacturing systems, we\\ndeveloped a light-weighted FIPA compliant agent frame-\\nwork called Autonomous Agent Development Environment\\n(AADE). It is worth pointing out that originating from the\\nperspective of engineering, the basic facilities provided by\\nAADE are open, ﬂexible and scalable, and are expected to\\naccelerate future research and development in agent based\\napplications in design and manufacturing.\\n\\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2\\nintroduces FIPA standards and compares three well-known\\nagent platforms that implement FIPA speciﬁcations; Section\\n3 presents the architecture of AADE, its main components,\\nand the distinguished characteristics; Section 4 describes the\\nsystem architecture of the agent based collaborative design\\nand engineering environment, its composed agents, and the\\ndeveloped software prototype based on AADE; Section 5\\nconcludes the paper with our contributions and future\\nconsiderations.\\n\\n2. FIPA compliant agent platforms\\n\\nAgent\\n\\nlevel abstraction in software\\nengineering. Agent based approaches alleviate the high\\n\\nis a higher\\n\\ncoupling of distributed objects by using a message passing\\ncommunication paradigm. In a multi-agent system, an agent\\nis characterized by its autonomous and cooperative\\ncapabilities, such as independent reasoning and local\\ndecision making, handling incoming messages and mana-\\nging multiple tasks at the same time. However, the agent\\ntechnology seems to be too complicated for practical\\napplications without the provision of essential components\\nthat form the baseline for agent system development\\nprocess. Moreover, for many reasons, agents developed by\\ndifferent organizations are difﬁcult to interoperate because\\nof the lack of a common messaging and ontology interface.\\nFIPA [11], founded in 1996, is an international standard-\\nization organization promoting the development and\\nspeciﬁcation of agent\\ntechnologies. The main goal for\\nFIPA speciﬁcations is to specify how different kinds of\\nagent platforms can interoperate. In the context of FIPA, an\\nagent is an encapsulated entity with its own states, behavior,\\nthread of control, and an ability to interact and communicate\\nwith other entities-including people, other agents, and\\nlegacy systems [12].\\n\\nFIPA offers a set of application independent speciﬁca-\\ntions which have covered almost all the topics concerning\\nagent technology, including agent life cycle management,\\nagent communication, ontology, agent mobility and\\nsecurity. Basically, FIPA abstract architecture speciﬁes:\\nin the directory facilitator (DF), a yellow page function-\\nality to support service registration and discovery; in the\\nagent management system (AMS), a white page function-\\nality to enforce agent naming service and agent life cycle\\nmanagement; and in the message transport service (MTS),\\nthe default communication method between agents on\\ndifferent agent platforms or within the same platform.\\nMTS may include an advanced message routing function-\\nalities (agent communication channel, ACC) on top of\\nsingle or multiple message transport protocols (MTP, such\\nas HTTP and IIOP). Fig. 1 shows the abstract architecture\\nof FIPA speciﬁcations.\\n\\nMTS is a ﬂexible part which could vary from one\\nagent platform to another. Some platforms use the MTS to\\nhandle only the cross-platform messages and let agents\\nwithin the same agent platform communicate directly;\\nwhile some other platforms use the MTS to handle all\\nmessages running both inside and outside its residing\\nagent platform.\\n\\nFIPA speciﬁcations have reached such a maturity that\\nFIPA compliant agent systems have been implemented by\\nvarious developers. More than one hundred agent toolkits or\\nplatforms have been developed and presented in the\\nliterature or on the Web, with different mixes of mobility,\\nadaptability, intelligence, ACL and multi-language support\\n[13]. Among them, three well known agent platforms are:\\nJADE [14,15], FIPA-OS [16,17] and Zeus [18,19]. Using\\nagents as the unit of encapsulation, all these three agent\\nplatforms can provide an agent code base that liberates\\ndevelopers from the laborious work of building basic agent\\n\\n\\x0cQ.

FIPA abstract architecture.\\n\\nHowever, working with a speciﬁc agent platform has\\nsome drawbacks. First of all, the code is portable only if\\ndelivered with the host platform (e.g. JADE). Second, the\\nlimitation of documentation and licensing problem hinder\\nits adaptability to engineering applications. Many\\nindustrial customers would like to protect their intellec-\\ntual property, which could not be guaranteed by codes\\nunder open-source agreement. Third, the code efﬁciency\\nis also a serious problem. Because the purpose of these\\nagent platforms is simply to break down general agent\\nfrom domain related problems from the viewpoint of\\ncomputer science discipline,\\ntarget may not be\\nbalanced and optimized to ﬁt special requirements of\\nengineering applications.\\n\\nthis\\n\\nIn this paper, we present an FIPA compliant agent\\nframework proposed and developed particularly for engin-\\neering applications.\\n\\n3.

In a non-exclusive modular\\nmodel, software modules (entities) conﬁned in different\\nboxes can access or utilize each other directly across their\\nboundaries. These relationships between modules could be\\ntoo complicated to draw in one single diagram. However, in\\nthe view of object encapsulation, these relationships can be\\nhided behind the external interfaces of Java classes.\\n\\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the agent infrastructures or common\\nfunctionalities are abstracted and associated with each agent\\nrole. There are four major packages developed in AADE.\\nThe following subsections describe these packages as well\\nas other domain dependant modules, and brieﬂy discuss the\\nimportant features of AADE.\\n\\n3.1. Communication package\\n\\nThe lower level agent communication is conducted\\nthrough a peer-to-peer transport protocol, TCP/IP socket.\\nThe Communication Interface module\\nis\\nimplemented by two independent threads: a SocketLis-\\ntener and a SocketSender to handle the data stream\\nﬂowing both ways in the speciﬁed communication sockets\\nand the messages in the message queues.

Hao et al. / Advanced Engineering Informatics 19 (2005) 123–134\\n\\n127\\n\\nThe Message Queues module intends to accomplish\\nfunctions of message buffering and scheduling in an agent.\\nFour kinds of message queues are handled together by this\\npackage: QInBox, QOutBox, QReceived and QSent.\\nThe two socket communication threads mentioned above\\nare basically linked with QInBox and QOutbox and the\\ninner movements of messages among these boxes are\\nprocessed in similar ways as regular email handling\\nsystems. Simple matching mechanisms are developed in\\nthe SocketListener to collect basic information (i.e.\\nSender, Date, Receiver, etc.) and to make sure that only the\\nexpected messages are passing to its Message Queues.\\n\\n3.2. Messaging package\\n\\nFIPA deﬁned 22 communicative acts (performatives) and\\n11 interaction protocols so that agents can interact under a\\nuniversal message oriented communication language. In\\nAADE, we only implement a subset of these communicative\\nacts based on the interaction protocols chosen for the related\\nengineering applications. The most frequently used protocol\\nis the FIPA Request protocol (Fig. 3).

FSM diagram of FIPA Request initiator.\\n\\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the Message Handling module\\ndeals with the payload of messages that are represented in\\nFIPA ACL, while the Conversation Control module\\nmaintains a conversation list, enforces the sequences of\\nFIPA protocols, and controls the states of conversations.\\nBecause the content in ACL is represented by the XML\\nformat, the corresponding ACL Parser is responsible for\\nunderstanding the meaning of content in message payload\\nafter the XML parser (in Utility package) distilling the\\npayload information.\\n\\nThe sequences of agent\\n\\ninteractions are represented\\nseparately as Finite State Machine (FSM) diagrams for each\\nagent roles. Taking FIPA Request protocol as an\\nexample, there are two agent roles participated in this\\nprotocol:\\nthe Initiator and the Participant. While the\\nsequence diagram in Fig. 3 provides a society level view\\nof interaction, the state machine charts in Fig. 4 represent\\nthe internal processing sequence of the agent performing the\\nInitiator\\nrole. This FSM based conversation control\\nmechanism is very powerful and because of its generality,\\nall kinds of FIPA protocols and even the user-deﬁned\\nprotocols can be easily expressed using this kind of\\nabstraction. Through the representation of FSM, the ‘data’\\nmodel and ‘control’ mechanism of protocols can be\\nseparated, making the protocols easily deﬁnable and the\\nprotocol management modules reusable.\\n\\n3.3. General function package\\n\\nBy referencing FIPA management speciﬁcations, we\\nabstract general functionalities that all agents commonly\\nshare with. These functionalities are packed as the\\nGeneral Function package.\\n\\nThe directory facilitator (DF) is a component in AADE\\nthat provides the white pages and yellow pages directory\\nservices to all other agents. It is an agent that combines\\n\\n\\x0c128\\n\\nQ. Hao et al. / Advanced Engineering Informatics 19 (2005) 123–134\\n\\nto register\\n\\nthe functionalities of AMS and DF described in FIPA. The\\nresponsibility of Registration module is to handle\\nregistration functions on both sides of agents (either DF\\nagent or agents other than DF). The agent identiﬁcation\\n(AID), including agent name and its transport descriptions,\\nis registered to the DF agent.\\nIn particular, special\\ninformation of agents representing engineering resources\\n(PS Agents as described in Section 4) is included in agent’s\\nconﬁguration ﬁle to enable an agent\\nits\\nengineering capabilities (domain dependant) as well. The\\noperations concerning registration process include: reg-\\nister, deregister, modify, search, push-\\nRegistry and the leaseTime control mechanism.\\nAmong these operations, only pushRegistry is not\\nspeciﬁed in FIPA. We designed this operation originating\\nfrom the DF to other agents to push the new updates of agent\\nregistry to all agents listed on the current registration table.\\nFrom implementation point of view, the major difference\\nbetween pushRegistry and other operations is that it is\\nimplemented through a one-way message rather than a\\ncomplete conversation. Because the system does not need to\\ncheck and guarantee whether the receiver could actually get\\nthe updates,\\nthe workload of system and network is\\nsigniﬁcantly reduced.\\n\\nSimilar to the Registration module, Scheduling\\nand Agent Management modules provide supports for\\nregular software maintenance (such as backup, restore,\\nlogging and exceptions, from the viewpoint of software\\nengineering) and overseeing the transition of agent states in\\nmultiple conversations (from the viewpoint of agent\\nengineering), respectively. The speciﬁcations of FIPA\\nagent management system (AMS) are partially implemented\\nto meet the requirements of agent lift cycle management in\\nAADE.\\n\\n3.4. Utility package\\n\\nAlthough agent is believed to represent a higher level of\\nabstraction in software engineering, it still needs to possess\\nbasic functionalities that any software entity should have. In\\nthe utility package, we provide an agent with some software\\nengineering facilities, such as database operations, ﬁle\\noperations, FTP client, email handling, exception handling,\\nlogging operations, XML parsing, general interface com-\\nponents, and various zipping classes (for message security\\nand encoding).\\n\\n3.5. Domain dependant modules\\n\\nIn AADE, application-speciﬁc agents can be constructed\\nby customizing the interfaces of the generic agent model.\\nThe parts needed to be specialized are depicted as three dark\\nblocks on the right side of Fig. 2.\\n\\nA User Interface is required for some agents to\\nshow its running state, incoming and outgoing messages,\\nlogging ﬁles, and so on to the human users. The user\\n\\ninterface may differ from agent to agent depending on the\\ntypes of agents. Some are just for monitoring purpose and\\nothers may require menus or buttons for user’s intervention.\\nSophisticated user\\ninterfaces may provide intelligent\\nassistance to users [24]. However, all kinds of user\\ninterfaces can still be quickly built up by using the common\\ncomponents in the Utility package.\\n\\nIn our case study, a number of commercial or self-\\ndeveloped engineering software tools are to be wrapped as\\ncorresponding problem solving agents (PS agent) (details\\ndescribed in Section 4). As a result, the AADE agent model\\nhas an Application Interface and a separate\\nrunning thread for executing and monitoring a certain\\nkind of engineering software tool. The Application\\nInterface needs to be developed one by one according\\nto the requirements of a real engineering project.\\n\\nleast\\n\\nThe Learning/Reasoning/Problem Solving\\nintelligence in.\\nis the place to put an agent’s special\\nAccording to its deﬁnition, an agent is usually a software\\nsystem that enjoys at\\nthe following properties:\\nautonomous, cooperative, reactive, proactive, and ration-\\nality [25]. Each agent has its beliefs, knowledge, desires and\\nintentions. In AADE, we include all the agent functions\\nrelated to knowledge, learning, rule-based reasoning, case-\\nbased reasoning and domain dependant problem solving\\nstrategies in this composite block so that the development of\\nagents could be simpliﬁed by customizing as less\\ncomponents as possible.\\n\\n3.6. Important features\\n\\nThe important features of AADE provide a foundation\\nfor the development of open, dynamic, ﬂexible, and reliable\\n(fault\\ntolerant) multi-agent systems, which are very\\nimportant for real world engineering applications.\\n\\n3.6.1. Multi-threading\\n\\nEach agent deals with multiple threads at the same time\\nto handle concurrent tasks. Fig. 2 shows brieﬂy the threads\\nthat an agent in AADE should have using boxes with dark\\nshadow. As mentioned before, two threads are committing\\nto the socket communication, one thread takes care of\\nexecution of the wrapped external program, while the Main\\nThread and Problem Solving Threads take the\\nroles of periodic scheduling, event-driven scheduling,\\ncoordinating, and domain-dependant tasks’ scheduling.\\n\\n3.6.2. Multi-layered message frame and message handling\\nThe structure of message (messageFrame is used as a\\nterminology in AADE) contains multi-layered information\\nas depicted in Fig. 5. An AADE message envelope is added\\non the standard FIPA envelope to enable advanced\\nmessaging functions. For example, msgLevel is used to\\ndifferentiate the priority level of a message so that urgent\\nmessages in the QInBox and QOutBox could be treated\\ndifferently. Also the Responder could be used to specify\\n\\n\\x0cQ.

With this mechanism, it is possible that\\nmessages are directed to (or pulled by) different threads of\\nan agent. The true multi-threading can only be implemented\\nwith centralized message scheduling being eliminated as\\nmuch as possible.\\n\\nSimilarly, the message handling mechanism involves a\\nmulti-layered architecture. Fig. 6 shows the ﬁve layers of\\nmessage handling in AADE. From bottom to top, they are:\\nnetwork layer, communication layer, message layer,\\nconversation layer and problem solving layer. The reference\\nrelationships of these layers with related data structures are\\nalso shown in Fig. 6 on the right hand side. The good\\npartition of software components demonstrated in AADE\\ncould beneﬁt a feasible, ﬂexible, reliable and maintainable\\nmulti-agent application system.\\n\\n3.6.3.

Layered message handling.\\n\\nThis is a strategy that represents more precisely of\\nthe agent’s ‘loosely coupling’ and ‘autonomous’ concepts\\ncompared with the tightly coupled client-server RMI\\ninvocation used in JADE and FIPA-OS. The communi-\\ncation package is designed to be the internal functionalities\\nof each individual agent rather than having a shared MTS to\\nhandle the intra-agent platform messages. In other words,\\nwe expect the MTS to deal with the cross agent platform\\nmessages only.\\n\\n3.6.4. Originated from and serving to the engineering ﬁelds.\\nSection 4 presents an example of using AADE to develop an\\nagent based collaborative environment for product design\\nand engineering. From this prototype, we could demonstrate\\nthe adaptability of AADE to engineering applications. The\\nagent knowledge base, problem solving abilities, conﬁgur-\\nation ﬁle, registration information, and more specially, the\\ninclusion of an engineering data management agent (EDM\\nagent) could greatly accelerate the development process of\\nengineering multi-agent systems. The related supporting\\nfacilities in Utility package contribute to this feature as\\nwell, such as facilities dealing with engineering ﬁles and ﬁle\\ntransportation (FTP client).\\n\\nBeneﬁting from the object oriented programming and\\ncomponent technologies, AADE provides reusable software\\nlibraries, interfaces and agent development templates that\\ncan be speciﬁed for agent implementation. Development\\ntools that facilitate the development, conﬁguration, debug-\\nging, monitoring and visualization of multi-agent systems\\nare included in our future research and development plan.\\nMore features will be added to the feature list of AADE\\nprogressively.\\n\\n4. A prototype for e-Engineering design\\nand optimization\\n\\nThis section presents our\\n\\nrecent project on the\\ndevelopment of a collaborative product design and\\nengineering environment using agent and Web-based\\ntechnologies. A case study used to validate the prototype\\nenvironment is the design of a wheel-axle assembly (part of\\na bogie system). More information about this project as well\\nas our long-term strategies of e-Engineering services\\nparadigm can be found in [26].\\n\\n4.1. Prototype system architecture\\n\\nThe architecture of this prototype system for engineering\\ndesign and optimization is shown in Fig. 7. It is designed\\nand developed based on AADE. System functions include\\nproject management, job management, user management,\\nengineering data management and system integration with\\ndifferent kinds of engineering software tools. A number of\\nsoftware agents have been designed.\\n\\n\\x0c130\\n\\nQ.

Architecture of an agent based e-engineering design and optimization system.\\n\\n4.1.1. e-Engineering server agent (ES agent)\\n\\nIt is the gateway that users must get through to deﬁne,\\nmanage, and monitor the information about a design project\\nand its afﬁliated design jobs. Therefore, all manipulations of\\nengineering data related to the project, workﬂow, design job\\nand tasks are done by the EDM agent (see below) through\\nthe ES agent. Every time when a design job starts running,\\nthe ES agent generates a job agent dynamically. The reverse\\nprocess happens when the ES detects that a job has been\\nﬁnished.\\n\\n4.1.2. Engineering data management agent (EDM agent)\\n\\nThe EDM agent is a proactive engineering data service\\nagent. EDM has the knowledge of database location,\\nconnection conﬁguration, engineering ﬁle directories, and\\nlocation and conﬁguration of FTP server, etc. It provides\\ndatabase and ﬁle system operation services, such as creating\\n\\ndata sets for a new job, updating design data, retrieving\\ndesign tasks, and helping send data ﬁles proactively to the\\ntarget agents before a job starts.\\n\\n4.1.3. Job agent (JA)\\n\\nA job agent communicates with the EDM agent for\\nstoring and retrieving job data; with the DF agent for\\nsearching matched PS agents; and with the problem solving\\nagents (PS agent) for negotiation based design tasks’\\nallocation. A job agent is created and dissolved dynamically\\nby the ES agent to control the design job it represents.\\n\\n4.1.4. Directory facilitator agent (DF agent)\\n\\nIt has all the registration service functionalities for other\\nagents residing in this multi-agent system; keeps up-to-date\\nagent registration and informs all registered agents with\\n\\n\\x0cQ. Hao et al. / Advanced Engineering Informatics 19 (2005) 123–134\\n\\n131\\n\\nupdated registry; and provides lookup and matching-making\\nservices to job agents.\\n\\n4.1.5. Interface agent (IA)\\n\\nUser requests enter the agent system through the Web-\\nbased user interfaces. Several Servlets are responsible for\\nreceiving these requests on the Web server. The IA then\\ncatches the user requests from Servlets,\\ntranslates the\\nrequests to messages, and initiates corresponding conversa-\\ntions to related agents. On the other hand, when the agent\\nsystem reaches a result, the IA creates updates to user\\ninterfaces based on the replies from agents. So, the IA is a\\nkind of application that functions mainly as a two-way\\nbridge connecting the Web-based user interfaces and the\\nback-end agent systems.\\n\\n4.1.6. Problem solving agent (PS agent)\\n\\nIn this project,\\n\\nPS is the actual engineering problem solving agent. A PS\\nagent not only carries out the communication, negotiation\\nfunctions on behalf of engineering software, but also\\nexecutes the execution thread to do the related analysis,\\nsimulation or optimization based on the parameters\\nprovided by the EDM Agent.\\nfour\\nengineering software tools are wrapped and integrated:\\nIRONCAD v 6.0 (for 3D graphical modeling), DADS v 9.6\\n(for dynamic analysis), ANASYS v 7.1 (for structural\\nanalysis), and AFA (for fatigue analysis). Considering\\nIRONCAD is a standalone interactive 3D modeling soft-\\nware tool which is difﬁcult to execute automatically by the\\nsystem, its representative PS Agent is treated differently as\\nan empty node (shown as a dark circle in Fig. 7). In this\\nspecial case, IRONCAD software must be installed on the\\ndesigner’s local site. Its representing PS agent does not have\\nthe execution interface as other PS agents and the\\nIRONCAD task is manipulated and submitted manually\\nby the human user.\\n\\n4.1.7. Monitoring agent (MA)\\n\\nMA is specially designed to facilitate the monitoring of\\nagents’ behaviors in the multi-agent system. In a distributed\\nmulti-agent system, because information is distributed and\\ncontrolled by each individual agent, it is necessary to have\\nan agent that could accumulate information from various\\nresources when required. Through this monitoring agent,\\ndynamic ‘condition’ of the system, the behavior of this\\nmulti-agent environment as well as all individual agents can\\nbe conveniently monitored or reviewed through a graphical\\ntool provided to the user.\\n\\n4.2. Prototype implementation\\n\\nC/CCC, FORTRAN, and Visual Basic, are also used for\\nlegacy systems integration. All agents are implemented on\\nAADE. The EDM agent\\nis implemented to integrate\\nMySQLe as the primary database for the entire system.\\nServer side modules are implemented on Apachee and\\nTomcate.\\n\\nThe behaviors of agents in AADE can be monitored\\nthrough two kinds of graphical interfaces of the monitoring\\nagent (Fig. 8).\\n\\nFigure 8(a) represents the agent interactions using a\\nsequence-style diagram. Analogous to the UML sequence\\ndiagram, messages between agents are displayed sequen-\\ntially according to their\\ntimes of occurrence. Agent\\ninteraction history can be easily traced from the top to the\\nbottom by scrolling the right-hand scroll bar in the window.\\nInformation of messages and conversations are also\\nassociated with the graph for the convenience of monitor-\\ning. Another style of interface in Fig. 8(b) shows message\\ninteractions among agents as directed arrows. This interface\\nis a dynamical one with only the current message is\\nhighlighted.\\n\\nSimple agent conﬁguration tool is implemented for the\\nagent construction process in AADE. However, advanced\\nagent construction, monitoring and development tools are\\ncurrently not available yet.\\n\\nA working prototype based on AADE is developed\\nthrough several agent interaction scenarios. More detailed\\ndescription about this prototype implementation could be\\nfound in [27]. Fig. 9 shows some screenshots of the\\ndeveloped prototype.\\n\\nFigure 9(a) is a project deﬁnition user interface. A ‘project\\nmanager’ can deﬁne the workﬂow of a design project\\n(including its composed tasks, control points and their\\nrelationships) by specifying a predeﬁned project workﬂow\\ntemplate. The purpose of deﬁning the workﬂow-based\\nproject\\nis to streamline heterogeneous activities in a\\nmultidisciplinary team so that distributed team members\\ncould collaborate on a project in an integrated environment.\\nFor legacy systems’ wrapping, we already developed a\\nparametric interface built in IRONCAD using Visual Basic.\\nBecause IRONCAD does not provide parametric modeling\\nfunctions, this interface supports the backend CAD modeler\\nto complete parameter change over the wheel-axle CAD\\nmodel. Our prototype system also provides a Web-based\\nuser interface for inputting similar parameters in the job\\ndeﬁnition of a project. Fig. 9(b) shows this Web-based job\\nparameter\\nthe wheel-axle design\\nproblem.\\n\\ninterface for\\n\\ninput\\n\\nThe software prototype environment is implemented on a\\nnetwork of PCs with Windows 2000/XP and Linux as well\\nas SUN workstations with the SUN UNIX environment.\\nJava is the primary programming language for system\\nimplementation.
