fact in many cases, one canadequately describe the kind of retrieval by simply substituting“document” for “information.” nevertheless, “informationretrieval” has become accepted as a description of the kind ofwork published by cleverdon, salton, spark jones, lancasterand others.', 'a perfectly straightforward deﬁnition along this lineis given by lancaster (1968): “information retrieval is the termconventionally, though somewhat inaccurately, applied to thetype of activity discussed in this volume.', 'an informationretrieval system does not inform (i.e.', 'change the knowledge of)the user on the subject of his inquiry.', 'it merely informs on theexistence (or non-existence) and whereabouts of documentsrelating to his request.” this speciﬁcally excludes question-answering systems as

expressed by kemp (1988), who,however, argued that “knowledge retrieval” should substi-tute for “information retrieval.”3 another deﬁnition is pro-vided by baeza-yates and ribeiro-neto

information items such as documents, web-pages,online catalogs, structured and semi-structured records, multi-media objects.', 'the representation and organization of the infor-mation should be such

based on the concept of simple polarity of opinions (negative, positive,neutral), specifies whether opinions hold positive, negative or neutral sentiments(cambria and white, 2014).', 'an opinion could be simply defined as a positive or negativesentiment, view, attitude, emotion or appraisal about an entity ( product, person, event,organization or topic) or an aspect of that entity from a user or

sources could be included to provide broader comparison passage amongproducts.', 'the research by xu, liao, li and song (2011) corrected these aforementionedshortcomings by providing a method of comparative relation extraction that not onlydetects the occurrence of relations, but also recognizes direction.', 'however, the unfixedinterdependencies among relations are overlooked; when addressed, better performance forrelation extraction may be achieved.', 'it is noticed that in the proposed work (xu, wang, ren,xu, liu and liao, 2011) more linguistic features could be explored, in

expressionbetween different languages, and the differences within a language with regard to thedifferent jargon and idiomatic expressions that are used within the bounds of a certainproduct or service domain.', 'from an analytical perspective, it has been observed thatdifferent authors use different datasets for the evaluation of their techniques, which maylimit comparisons between works; nonetheless, most of the methods discussed here haveused amazon datasets.', 'also, to break the barriers of the current methods through thedevelopment of commonsense knowledge bases to link both the

areaverse to reading whole opinions, finding them wholly inconvenient; summaries provide auseful, time-saving facility for informed decision making.', 'the products and servicesindustries are becoming increasingly aware of the value of regular and comparative om,which not only enables cross-correlation with more traditional marketing techniques, butmay circumvent some of the issues that traditional market surveys create, such as the lackof candor (commonly arising out of politeness) that results from direct questioning(cambria, grassi, hussain, and havasi, 2012).', \"furthermore, it may help to

research methods that promised tostrengthen causal inference (berkman, 2009).\", 'the null results of thesmall number of trials in social epidemiology coincided roughly witha series of more publicly discussed setbacks for other domains ofobservational epidemiology,for example in the unexpectedlyadverse effects observed in the beta-carotene and hormonereplacement therapy trials (smith et al.,

epidemiologists have historically asked causalquestions (even when they cloaked their conclusions in associa-tional language), how does prior work differ from the recentoutpouring of methods and writing that explicitly invokes causalinference goals?', 'the most marked divide between modern causalinference approaches and traditional approaches is not the statis-tical machinery, but rather that a causal inference approach beginsby articulating the assumptions necessary to support causal in-ferences (e.g., that treatment assignment is independent of thepotential outcomes, conditional on

and other domains ofepidemiology led to impassioned debate about the usefulness ofobservational research tools to anticipate trial results (smith et al.,2001; taubes et al., 1995).', 'this debate holds special weight in socialepidemiology because many social factors will probably never besubject to an ideal rct.', 'thus, if the ﬁeld concludes that observa-tional evidence cannot be trusted,

the probability of havingthe exposure ofinterest compared to a reference exposure(rosenbaum et al., 1983).', 'for example, in the simple case of a binaryexposure, the propensity score might be estimated using a logisticregression model, in which the binary exposure variable is a func-tion of potential confounding variables.propensity score methods are designed to balance the distri-bution of measured covariates (potential confounders) between theexposed and unexposed group.', 'if there are no unmeasured con-founders, this balancing of covariates mimics an rct.', 'the mostfamiliar propensity score method may be 1:1 nearest neighborpropensity score matching, in which each exposed individual iscompared to an unexposed individual with a similar propensityscore.', 'numerous other propensity score approaches often performbetter in terms of achieving covariate balance than this simpleapproach, however.', 'broadly, propensity score methods can becategorized into matching methods, subclassiﬁcation methods, andweighting methods (stuart, 2010).', 'subclassiﬁcation methods relyon stratifying analyses within subgroups of individuals with similarpropensity scores (rosenbaum et al., 1984).', 'weighting methodsinclude inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting (iptw) used toestimate marginal structural models (msms) (hern(cid:1)an et al., 2000,2006).propensity score methods can (and should) be integrated intoother analyses, for example, regression or g-computation (ho et al.,2007).', 'combining the propensity score approach with subsequentoutcome analysis can be thought of as doubly robust because thepropensity score approach models confounding in the treatmentmodel while the outcome-based analysis models confounding inthe outcome model.', 'in some situations, we may have a better un-derstanding of the exposure process e and the propensity scoremodel may be more likely to be correctly speciﬁed e whereas inother situations we may have a better understanding of theoutcome determinants, thus the outcome model may be a betterbet.', 'with a doubly robust model, correctly specifying either theexposure or outcome model provides unbiased estimates of theeffect of interest, even if the other model is misspeciﬁed.propensity score weighting methods such as iptw, which aretypically used to estimate msms, can be applied in longitudinalstudies to address time-varying confounding where the time-varying confounder is affected by the previous exposure and af-fects subsequent exposure and outcome (robins et al., 2000).because of the dynamic and powerful nature of many social ex-posures, time-varying confounders affected by prior exposure are acommon problem and msm-type approaches are proving prom-ising in longitudinal studies.', 'for example, cerda et al.', 'reexaminedthe link between neighborhood poverty and drinking frequencyusing the longitudinal coronary artery risk development in youngadults study, accounting for the potential time-varying confound-ing variables of income, education, and occupation using msms(cerd(cid:1)a et al., 2010).', 'these types of variables pose particular chal-lenges in neighborhood studies where they can act both as con-founders and also mediators.', 'cerda et al.', 'found that the msmestimate that accounted for the time-varying nature of these con-founders was stronger than the typical regression estimate andstatistically signiﬁcant.', 'gilsanz et al.', 'implemented msms to eval-uate the effects of changes in depressive symptoms on risk ofsubsequent stroke (gilsanz et al., 2015).', 'msms were necessary inthis context to address time-varying confounding, in that the res-olution of depressive symptoms is inﬂuenced by past symptomseverity, behavioral patterns, and comorbidities, that are them-selves consequences of depression.', 'although dozens of previousstudies demonstrated that individuals with elevated depressivesymptoms also had high risk of stroke, these analyses did notdirectly address the most relevant question for guiding treatment:does reduction in depressive symptoms reduce stroke risk?', 'gilsanzfound that stroke risk remained elevated even for individualswhose depressive symptoms resolved between biennial assess-ments.', 'bias from time-varying confounders affected by priorexposure can also be addressed in outcome modeling, throughstructural nested models using g-computation (robins, 2000).although doubly-robust extensions of traditional msms exist(vansteelandt et al., 2014) we have not seen them applied in

the best available evidence in literature regarding the useof clinical case studies inserted in digital technologies for educationalpurposes and its collaboration to cognitive, procedural and attitudi-nal learning for nursing students, this review allows the followingconclusions:• even intending to identify papers in a worldwide stage in the present-ed theme, there were selected only 21 primary studies, denoting lackof researches in this area approaching the learning outcomes;• digital technologies used for educational purposes have been devel-oped with resources increasingly interactive and realistic, integratingseveral elements to motivate the student and stimulate learning, suchas videos, virtual simulation, avatar, images and communication tools;• to solve problems in clinical case studies the students had to developmany skills, specially theoretical foundation;• clinical case study inserted in digital technology for educational pur-poses provided different types of learning to nursing students, suchas cognitive, procedural and attitudinal.it is possible to conclude that the results obtained in this researchcan contribute to the adoption of educational practices guided by newinformation technologies, towards quality in nursing education as wellas continuous and permanent capacitation for nurses.besides, the results reinforce the wealth of digital technologies fornursing education and the potentiality of using these resources for vir-tual simulation tools and application of case studies in order to sustainand improve educational strategies.we believe that educational institutions are experiencing andadapting to paradigm shifts in teacher education and also reshapingthe aims of education, characterized by the articulation among theory,practice and research, covering a continuous development of knowledge.thus, the monopoly of knowledge previously held by the professor candissipate to other members involved in teaching and learning processthrough increased use of technology as a strategy to improve the trainingprocess as a whole.recommendations for future studiesit would be valuable to obtain data on the student learning withtechnology randomly divided the students in control and experimentalgroups.', 'it is also necessary to develop studies regarding the articulationthe three types of learning (cognitive,

[14].other data mining algorithms have achieved similar(40 %) workload savings [16] but recall (identifying rele-vant records) was lower (90 to 95 %), partly because test-ing was performed on datasets without a specificallyassociated research question.', 'this makes comparisonswith the results of this study difficult.', 'whilst another textmining algorithm [17] achieved workload savings rangingfrom 8.5 to 62 % with 15 test datasets, which are similarto our findings with abstrackr (9 to 80 %), their resultswere based on a threshold of a minimum 95 % recall ofrelevant studies, which is too low for

resulted had we screened larger reviews.nonetheless, the results provide a reasonable estimate ofthe algorithm’s typical performance during semi-automatedscreening.this study and others that have evaluated semi-auto-mated screening with support vector models [14, 15], se-mantic vector models [16], and complement naïve bayesmodels [17] indicate that considerable workload savingscan be achieved.', 'the ability to identify all relevant citationswith abstrackr was very high but imperfect.', 'such accuracy,however, is acceptable as a stand-alone tool for scopingsearches and non-systematic reviews where not every pub-lished study needs to be included.', 'it is noteworthy, however,that human citation screening is imperfect with relevantstudies wrongly excluded [25].', 'given that abstrackr’s in-accuracy is similar to a human screener, it could be utilisedas the second screener.', 'abstrackr’s classification predictionmodel uses a somewhat arbitrary cutoff point at which theproportion of citations screened triggers the algorithm pre-diction.', 'however, this suggests that an adjustable stoppingheuristic could be used, so accuracy could be further im-proved albeit with the trade-off that more citations arescreened during the training phase.future developments with semi-automated screeningwould benefit from retaining the original classificationmodel developed during the original review, so future sys-tematic review updates may be screened automaticallywithout the re-input of a reviewer.', 'abstrackr is not cur-rently a fully integrated tool, and only the unscreened cita-tions (the predictions) are exportable with only the titlebibliographic details made available, and further develop-ments are needed to create a fully integrated tool that sys-tematic reviewers and information specialists can use.text mining algorithms that would enable systematic re-viewers to exploit the labelling of keywords towards biasingthe predictive classification model to further enhance per-formance have been proposed [26].', 'this approach could befurther aided by citation enrichment.', 'for example, key-words of high relevance such as the picos details shouldimprove the recall accuracy of semi-automated screeningalgorithms (and trial searching).', 'enriching citations isalready being used for the embase project [27] by codingcitations

the relevant studies foundduring the search process while excluding irrelevantstudies.consequently, the eﬀectiveness of the selection algorithm can bemeasured by the level of true positive (tp) and true negative (tn)classiﬁcations (studies correctly classiﬁed as include and exclude, re-spectively), false positive (fp) errors (including a study that should berejected) and false negative (fn) errors (excluding a study that shouldbe included).the traditional proportions of each type of error (fp or fn) withrespect to the total number of studies classiﬁed provide a general in-dicator of classiﬁer performance, but may be misleading due to theasymmetry between the portions of relevant and irrelevant documentstypically found in the corpus [13].', 'therefore, alternative measures theﬁeld of information retrieval, recall and precision, are used here.an indicator of the lack of fn errors is deﬁned by the recall statistic(1)(2)[13]:recall=tp+fntpprecision=tp+tpfpthus, recall measures the percent of relevant studies that are re-trieved, and is a measure of completeness.', 'a maximum recall measureof 1.0 signiﬁes the inclusion of all relevant studies, with recall measuresless than one indicating increased fn errors.an indicator of fp errors is found in the measure of precision [13]:thus, precision measures the percentage of retrieved documentsthat are relevant, and is an indicator of exactness.', 'a maximum precisionmeasure of 1.0 signiﬁes the exclusion of all irrelevant studies, withmeasures less than one indicating an increase in the number of fp er-rors.research process eﬃciency is also an important metric to assess, asrequired research eﬀort may be an impediment to the undertaking ofsuch research and may reduce the accuracy of results due to fatigue.using the approaches proposed in this research, the researcher analyzesa subset of the search corpus (hereafter referred to simply as a corpus)to train the classiﬁer, deciding which studies within the training set arerelevant (included) and irrelevant (excluded).', 'once the classiﬁer isapplied, the researcher completes the study selection step with only thealgorithm-included studies, manually removing those included erro-neously by the classiﬁer.in this context, researcher eﬃciency savings are obtained by redu-cing the number of irrelevant studies that must be read by the re-searcher, by reducing the proportion of studies in the algorithm trainingset and reducing classiﬁer fp errors.', 'this is consistent with prior re-search which argues that the time required to review articles is a targetfor optimization [see 14,15].', 'therefore, this research deﬁnes the eﬃ-ciency savings as the percentage of study inclusion / exclusion decisionsthat the researcher must make in training the

the epidemiological approach usingspeciﬁc research methods.', 'choice ofreliable methods,including denominators, data completeness and systematicdata collection, is essential in the epidemiological approach.however,these considerations are likely to be secondaryin acausation is paramount.unfortunately,identifying error causes without consistent,reliable measures is unlikely to lead to

of medication errorsin 21 of 45 studies, it was not possible to determine a preva-lence of medication errors due to lack of valid denominators.these were in particular studies using reporting

prevalence of 75% was found, with the majoritybeing below ,10% (tables 2–4).an average of nine error types (min/max: 1/38) were ident-iﬁed in 38 of the 45 studies.', 'in seven studies no error typeswere included due to study design.', 'the study having one errortype, namely, overdose (gentamicin) accounted for the highestprevalence in the review.', 'unfortunately, it was not possible toretrieve prevalence in the study using the highest number oferror types, as data were collected from voluntary reporting.dosing errors were the most frequent single error type, and instudies including all stages in the medication process, prescrib-ing errors accounted for the highest percentage.deﬁnitionsofthe 45 deﬁnitions, 26 differed in wording and/orcontent.', 'one deﬁnition used harm or potential for harm asa criterion for medication error, whereas one explicitlyincluded intercepted medication errors [27–29].', 'finally, ﬁvedeﬁnitions were limited to deviations between ordered

and/or content.tables 2–4 provide an overview of deﬁnitions and character-istics of each study.', 'table 2 shows 15 deﬁnitions using theword ‘error/s’ followed by information about included stagesin the medication process.', 'in seven deﬁnitions, informationregarding injury or intercepted errors is stated.', 'table 3reveals characteristics of 17 studies using the deﬁnition fromncc merp [22].',

association between deﬁnitionand prevalencein the ﬁrst category (table 2),it was possible to ascertainprevalence in all studies ranging from 2 to 75% with the twoeuropean studies as the main contributors.', 'in the secondcategory (table 3), which included studies using the deﬁ-nition from ncc merp, it was possible to retrieve preva-lence in 1 out of 17 studies, due to the use of reportingsystems.', 'this study revealed a prevalence of 8%.', 'in the thirdcategory (table 4) consisting of ﬁve studies using the term‘failure’,it was not possible to provide information aboutprevalence due to study design and data collection methods.finally,in the fourth category (table 4), a prevalence of3–16% was observed in studies focusing on deviationsbetween ordered and administered drugs/doses.to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to systematicallyexplore the extent and impact of generic deﬁnitions ofdiscussion510medication errors in hospital settings.', 'the literature reviewconﬁrmed an inconsistent use of deﬁnitions.', 'however, otheraspects have to be considered in order to explain the vari-ation in prevalence of medication errors, as interpretation ofthe included deﬁnitions did not suggest any tendencies.it is of particular relevance that fewer than half of thestudies explicitly deﬁned medication errors either as anoverall deﬁnition (generic) or a stage/route-speciﬁc term.furthermore, fewer than a quarter presented a generic deﬁ-nition despite that being the main objective of the studies.thus, the inconsistency in terminology only represents thetip of the iceberg.', 'additionally, the present review has con-ﬁrmed that the overall poor understanding of the epidemiol-ogy of medication errors can, at least, partly be explained bychoice of design, data collection methods and study popu-lation, including denominators [19–21, 23].', 'based on theseshortcomings, we have revealed a prevalence of 2–75% instudies that included a generic deﬁnition of medication error.the second important problem is the choice of denomi-nator or study population.', 'it has previously been suggestedthat to use opportunities for errors rather than number ofpatients as denominator reduces the risk of case-mix bias[26].', 'here we demonstrated a variety of denominators includ-ing drug order, doses, opportunities for errors, patients,nurses, reports and triggers.', 'in addition, the frequent use ofa reporting system excluded calculation of valid prevalence inalmost half of all the studies thereby increasing the lack ofclarity.thirdly, the impact of error types should be considered.', 'itcould be assumed that increasing the number of error typesbeing measured, would automatically result in higher occur-rences of medication errors due to an increased probabilityof detecting more errors.', 'however,the study with thehighest prevalence of errors (75%) in the present reviewincluded only one error type, namely, dosing errors, whichconﬂicts with this assumption [35].', 'on the other hand, notall error types are mutually exclusive e.g.', 'dosing errors, whichinevitably includes all errors resulting in wrong or omitteddose (under-dose, overdose, omission of dose).', 'thus, thenumber of error types has to be weighed against type oferror and theerror detection methods.unfortunately, the present review did not provide sufﬁcientinformation on the impact of error types with regard toprevalence.sensitivity offinally, choice of data collection method should be con-sidered important.', 'previously, chart review has been con-sidered as the most appropriate method to detect prescribingerrors and direct observation the most sensitive method todetect dispensing and administration errors, as opposed tovoluntary reporting, which was found to be the least sensitivemethod [32, 36].', 'in recent years the availability of computer-generated signals in error detection has increased, whichincidents that have beenallow an objective detection of alldeﬁned as an error in the computer.', 'thus,it can beassumed that such systems will increase the detection of sys-tematic documented electronic data such as dosing of

range inprevalence of medication errors.', 'a closer scrutiny revealedthat 10 of 15 studies in this category were afﬁliated with thesame institutions in boston, usa [7, 15, 28, 37 –43].', 'inaddition, these studies demonstrated the lowest occurrenceof medication errors ranging from 2 to 8% regardless ofwhether intercepted errors were included or not, suggestingconsistency in error detection methods.', 'however, prevalencein the two studies from europe exceeded the americanstudies by as much as eight times, despite use of virtuallyidentical deﬁnitions [10, 35].', 'no obvious circumstances canexplain these extreme differences, apart from use of data col-lection methods, as the study with the highest prevalenceused computer-generated signals to detect dosing errors [35].the majority of studies used the deﬁnition by ncc merp.unfortunately, it was only possible to retrieve one valid preva-lence of medication errors [44].', 'this deﬁnition was initiallydeveloped for medication error reporting and, therefore, wasan obvious choice for studies using reporting systems, whichwas the case for almost all the studies in this category [22].', 'animportant drawback to reporting systems is an increased riskof underestimating the occurrence of medication errors due tothe reporter’s awareness of errors, attitudes towards reportingerrors and fear of sanctions [45].', 'in addition, reportingsystems are by nature denominator free as they do not provideinformation on the whole population; on the contrary, retro-spective ﬁtted denominators, such as time period or admis-sions, are frequently employed to demonstrate error rates [26].thus, reports of incidence or prevalence in studies usingreporting systems should be avoided or interpreted withcaution.', 'unfortunately, this expelled a unique opportunity tocompare prevalence in studies using identical deﬁnitions.surprisingly, only 1 of the 45 deﬁnitions restricted medi-cation errors to failures that either result in harm or have thepotential to lead to harm [27].', 'contrary to other deﬁnitionsof medication errors in the present review, this approachrelates process and outcome factors within the same deﬁ-nition, which previously has been suggested as minimizingthe risk of accepting associations between errors and pro-cesses as synonyms for causation [46].', 'moreover, this deﬁ-nition has been tested in an australian study,in which itproved to be the most robust among other deﬁnitions, whenevaluated in comparison with different medication errorscenarios [25].', 'however, due to the design of this study itwas not possible to elucidate that a restricted deﬁnitionwould lead to lower occurrences of medication errors com-pared with more profound deﬁnitions [15].finally, deﬁnitions that considered a medication error as adeviation between an ordered and administered drug and doseseemed to be more homogeneous with regard to prevalencedespiteand employingrepresenting differentcountries516different study designs [30, 32–34, 47].', 'however,thesestudies predominantly used the same types of denominator(opportunities for errors; doses and orders) as well as themost sensitive and appropriate data collection methods, e.g.direct observation in studies of dispensing and administrationerrors.', 'a possible explanation for this consistency is the clear-cut limitation to deviations, which might appear simpler andbe a less subjective approach in determination of medicationerrors.', 'however, this approach excludes prescribing errors, asprescriptions serve as the gold standard in these deﬁnitions.limitationsthe aim of this review was to investigate the multiplicity ofdeﬁnitions used in studies having medication errors and/orades as the main objective.', 'hence, the characteristics andprevalence reported here might not reﬂect the overall occur-rence of medication errors.', 'however,it could be assumedthat prevalence ranging from 2 to 75% represents the vastmajority of studies in medication errors.', 'secondly, the litera-ture search was limited to four major databases and restrictedto papers in the english language.', 'it is, therefore, possiblethat studies that would have met the inclusion criteria, werenot indexed by these databases or were published in otherlanguages than english.', 'nevertheless, due to experience fromthe current literature search,in which studies from a timespan of .20 years were included, we assume that studies thatmight have been unintentionally disregarded in the searchstrategy would rather have added to the current inconsistencythan contributed to clariﬁcation of the terminology.', 'third,the groupings we selected were somewhat arbitrary and thismight have affected our chances of seeing an effect.conclusionsin the present systematic literature review of 45 studies wehave conﬁrmed inconsistency in deﬁning medication errorsas well as lack of deﬁnitions.', 'most of the deﬁnitions wereprofound, including minor deviations as well as fatal errors,whereas a single deﬁnition was restricted to harmful orpotentially harmful errors.most importantly, it appears that deﬁnitions of medicationerrors and methods of detection, rather than being reprodu-cible and reliable methods, are subject to individual research-er’s preferences.', 'thus,it is obvious that application of aclear-cut deﬁnition, standardized terminology and reliablemethods will greatly improve the quality and consistency ofmedication error ﬁndings.', \"efforts to achieve a commonlyaccepted deﬁnition that deﬁnes the scope and content isrequired in future studies.']\", None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None,

institute of medicine (iom) states:  “...the  search  for  trial  data  should  include  trial  registries  (clinicaltrials.gov,  clinical study  results,  current  controlled  trials,  and  who  international  clinical  trials registry),  fda  medical  and  statistical  reviews  records  …”  73    additionally,  the agency for healthcare research and quality (ahrq) states that:  “sources of grey literature  including  regulatory  data,  clinical  trial  registries  and  conference  abstracts should be searched in addition to bibliographic databases.” 74   how can we find data in regulatory agency sources?', ' searching for trial data in regulatory agency sources also presents challenges, but the  situation  is  improving,  as  described  above.', 'identifying  and  gaining  access  to csrs is, as yet, a relatively unexplored field but there is growing recognition of their importance.', 'the evidence on the relative value of the different types of unpublished information about clinical trials is still sparse, since access to csrs is a more recent phenomenon than access to trials registers.', ' resource implications  searching  for  trials  data  is  resource  intensive  and  adequate  budgeting  for  such searches  should  be  included  in  plans  for  systematic  reviews  and  other  evidence syntheses.', 'the  downloading,  management  and  archiving  of  records  from  registers and  other  such  sources  also  require  careful  planning  and  the  consideration  of  the  this article is protected by copyright.', 'all rights reserved.', 'cmost helpful software management tools  34.', 'accessing unpublished data is likely to be  a  combination  of  „traditional‟  searching  with  search  strategies  in  databases, detective work and negotiation with organisations who own or hold the data  34.', 'this suggests again that adequate resources are required to achieve access to the data, that the process may take significant amounts of time if negotiation is involved, that flexible identification approaches need to be adopted and documenting and reporting the  ways  data  were  identified  may  be  more  challenging  than  simply  recording „traditional‟ search methods and results.', ' scope and limitations of this review  clinical  trials  data  are  the  subject  of  an  extensive,  rich  research  literature  and  this paper  cannot  address  all  aspects.', 'this  paper  does  not  focus  on  what  systematic reviewers are currently reporting that they do in relation to trials register searching as this has been assessed in other publications  34 and was being audited in cochrane reviews  by  the  cochrane  editorial  unit  during  2017.', 'nor  does  it  focus  on  what reviewers  are  reporting  regarding  their  use  of  regulatory  agency  data  or  csrs,  as that is the topic of an ongoing study, (referred to above), funded under the cochrane methods  innovation  funding  programme,  which  will  initially  develop  guidance  on how  to  decide  whether  to  incorporate  csrs  and  other  regulatory  documents  into cochrane  reviews,  together  with  or  instead  of  data  from  published  studies  /  trials registers  (for  further  information  see:  methods.cochrane.org/methods-innovation-fund-2).', 'evidence of the scale and extent of non-publication of trials is also already well researched.', '75, 76  this  review  was  not  a  systematic  review  and  it  is  likely  that  more  extensive searches, particularly in languages other than english, might find additional studies.', '  what does the future hold?', ' journal  articles  and  clinical  trials  register  records  may  be  the  visible  part  of  the iceberg of trial data.', 'the new trial information consolidation and linking initiatives, as well  as  the  development  of  text  mining  and  machine  learning  tools,  offer  great promise for streamlining access to information which is currently time consuming to obtain  from  many  varied  resources.', 'these  initiatives  are  in  their  early  stages  in 2018,  but  merit  a  watching  brief  by  searchers  to  ensure  early  take  up  as  their benefits become clearer.', ' key points of advice for searching  researchers have reported on some aspects of the efficient searching of clinical trial registers, but there is an absence of detailed comparative data.', 'however, based on available research and experience we suggest the following key points of advice for searching:  this article is protected by copyright.', 'all rights reserved.', 'c ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●  each trial register has a different interface, so be prepared to transform the search strategy repeatedly.', 'trials  registers  often  have  relatively  few  records  and  therefore  often  the search can be achieved using only the most specific concept in the pico or other conceptual breakdown.', 'search  strategies  should  emphasise  sensitivity,  making  use  of  a  range  of synonyms and related terms for the concept(s) being searched.', 'trials register records can be very rich in detailed information and searchers should  explore  how  to  make  use  of  the  wide  range  of  fields  that  may  be available.', 'it is important to check whether the categories in fields which offer categorised information are applied consistently.', 'search  history  options  are  rare,  so  searchers  need  to  record  the  search history  in  detail,  electronically,  for  example  using  screenshot  software  (see below).', 'saved  searches  options  and  entry/update  codings  are  also  rare,  which means  that  searches  should  be  recorded  in  detail  (as  above)  to  make conducting update searches as streamlined as possible.', 'record selection options are rare in trials register interfaces and download options are not available in all interfaces.', 'searchers should consider how to download records from databases which may be very different to interfaces to large bibliographic databases.', 'searchers  should  consider  how  to  manage  and  screen  records  which  may be  very  different  in  content  and  structure  to  bibliographic  records  such  as medline  records.', 'screen  capture  software  and  note-taking  software  such as  evernote  or  onenote  may  help  with  managing  trials  register  searches and records.', 'trial  registration  is  uneven  across  specialties  and  countries,  therefore searchers should identify the available research on the degree of registration in the specialty and / or country for which they are searching and adjust the balance  of  searching  trials  registers  and  additional  search  approaches accordingly.', ' implications for research  the evidence of the relevance and importance of searching for unpublished research seems  well  established.', 'however,  the  research  literature  on  how  to  identify resources  and  how  to  search  resources  efficiently,  remains  sparse  and  there  are many topics which would benefit from research.', 'while we await the maturity of new consolidation  tools  such  as  opentrials,  more  research  is  needed  into  which resources  and  combinations  of  resources  are  most  important  for  identifying unpublished trial data in a range of topics.', 'there is clear evidence presented above that  some  specialties  and  disciplines  are  more  committed  to  trial  registration  than others  and  some  fields  may  not  be  registering  in  the  large  national  /  international this article is protected by copyright.', 'all rights reserved.', 'cdatabases  and  registers  but  in  other  types  of  research  register.', 'research  is  also needed into the best search approaches to use within individual trials registers and other  sources  of  unpublished  data,  and  how  far  trials  registers  overlap.', 'as consolidation  tools  such  as  opentrials  mature  we  will  need  evidence  on  their comprehensiveness, currency, and the efficiency of searching within them.', 'further research  could  also  be  conducted  on  how  to  identify  csrs,  regulatory  agency sources and other data provided by manufacturers.', '  conclusions  unpublished trial data can have a range of benefits and can be used in a variety of contexts.', 'although  identifying  resources  to  identify  these  data  can  be  relatively straightforward,  there  has  been  relatively  little  published  research  on  the  best approaches  to  searching  these  sources  such  as  trials  registers,  possibly  because this is a fast moving and rapidly changing field for research.', 'the available evidence suggests that there is no single resource which can be relied upon to give access to all trials, and that at present multiple registers should be searched as sensitively as possible.', 'searching  for  unpublished  data  on  websites  and  for  trial  information produced as csrs has received some research attention, but these resources are so  diverse  and  rapidly  changing  that  providing  evidence-based  advice  and recommendations is likely to be challenging.', '  references  1.',

databases, where it was collected or housed.', 'based on our experience, wefound grey literature still requires considerable time and effort to locate.there are numerous sources to locate grey literature, many of which have different search interfaces andcapabilities.', 'the vast number of sources requires a review team to make selections based on topic as well astime/resources.', 'we explored several sources that we felt were most promising for our topic listed in the variousguides.', 'furthermore, we were concerned about the reproducibility of results for some sources.', 'as giustini(2012) notes, google’s pagerank orders results by popularity, and therefore, it is possible that some relevant greyliterature may not rank high in the results or the ranking may change over time.', 'if we only included partial resultsof extremely large yields, we could risk missing relevant references and bias the results of the review regardless ofthe method used to select a subset.we also note that google ﬁlters results on the basis of browser version, geographic location and previouslyentered search strings (bates, 2011).', 'for systematic review searches, this raises issues regarding reproducibility.beyond web search engines, we found it was important that we searched numerous grey literature sources, asmany of the grey literature references that progressed to the data extraction stage came from a single database orfrom our supplemental, non-database searches.', 'had we not searched these sources, we would have missedrelevant references for the review.', 'it should be noted, however, that not one database contained all of therelevant peer-reviewed references.research in systematic review methodology for peer-reviewed literature on clinical effectiveness trials hasprovided some guidance about how many and which databases to search for a sufﬁciently comprehensive searchstrategy (e.g.', 'central, medline and embase for cochrane systematic reviews) (lefebvre et al., 2011).', 'greyliterature searches currently have no such guidelines to our knowledge.similar to others, we found that in developing our search strategies for grey literature databases requiredadditional care and creativity because of varying search capabilities of these databases as well as of web-basedsearch engines (benzies et al., 2006; rothstein and hopewell, 2009).', 'while we found that simple strategies werenecessary for some databases, several allowed the use of multiple boolean statements, the use of subjectheadings, phrase searching, wildcards and truncation.', 'we note that this is less feature of the search strategiesthemselves than the indexing and search functionality of the various sources.', 'adapting search strategies for greyliterature databases required additional work and testing as compared with those for peer-reviewed literature toensure capture of as many relevant references as possible.the issues of search yields posed challenges beyond the search itself.', 'some searches in google andgoogle scholar produced very large yields.', 'such large numbers can be difﬁcult and time consuming toexplore, sort, manage and process for inclusion in the review.in addition, references may not be in astandard bibliographic format making download and management in reference manager software arduous.in addition, duplicate references were challenging to screen out due to different citation formats andmissing citation information.inclusion of grey literature also imposed a burden on our review team increasing the number ofdocuments obtained, classiﬁed and reviewed at each stage.', 'for example, reviewers could not conﬁdentlyjudge relevance in the titles and abstract stage of the review due to missing citation information and/orabstracts in the grey literature.', 'we felt this occurred with a greater frequency with grey literature than withpeer-reviewed literature.reviewing grey literature posed another burden of time on reviewers related to format and length of documents.peer-reviewed literature typically conforms to a pre-speciﬁed format (i.e.', 'methods, results and discussion), and peer-reviewed journal page limitations

regarding reproducibility.beyond web search engines, we found it was important that we searched numerous grey literature sources, asmany of the grey literature references that progressed to the data

found that simple strategies werenecessary for some databases, several allowed the use of multiple boolean statements, the use of subjectheadings, phrase searching, wildcards and truncation.', 'we note that this is less feature of the search strategiesthemselves than the indexing and search functionality of the various sources.', 'adapting search strategies for greyliterature databases required additional work and testing as compared with those for peer-reviewed literature toensure capture of as many relevant references as possible.the issues of search yields posed challenges beyond the

decisionmaking (nazem and shin, 2002).cann andsupport vectormachines1393accordingly, data mining explores and analyzes data, automatically or semi-automatically, in order to discover relevant patterns, hidden to the database.', 'the maindata mining tasks are: categorical prediction (or classification); numeric prediction(“regression” type); numeric prediction (“trend identification” type); clustering analysis;and, frequent discovery patterns, discovering association and correlation rules (hanand kamber, 2006).', 'these tasks can predict trends and behaviors, enabling to makedecisions based on accumulated knowledge, and often overlooked, contained in thedatabases themselves.', 'thus, during the data mining tasks, existing but unknownpatterns and relationships can be identified, leading to generating hypotheses that areuseful to the user.for each type of data mining task, different techniques can be applied (han andkamber, 2006; wu et al., 2007), including those in the computational intelligence area(wang and fu, 2005).', 'computational intelligence techniques have proven to be efficientin solving data mining tasks because of their good ability to handle data from ill-defined contexts, where the rigid and highly accurate and restricted models areimpractical, something often found on data from real-world problems (abonyí et al.,2005).', 'furthermore, computational intelligence techniques that deal with approximatereasoning (such as fuzzy logic and probabilistic reasoning), inductive reasoning (suchas ann and svm) and evolutionary reasoning (such as evolutionary computingtechniques) are highly suitable for data mining since its context involves empirical andbehavior knowledge, in which information is inaccurate, incomplete and imperfect(abonyí et al., 2005).regarding the techniques that use inductive reasoning – ann and svm – they areboth similar, in how to explore a data mining problem and also in how to provide thesolution, regarded as equivalent in their most basic forms (cristianini and shawe-taylor, 2000).', 'nevertheless, svm has additional characteristics in the optimizationsolution model, since it also has the structural risk minimization of the model, besidesthe empirical risk minimization (vapnik, 1995).', 'ann, in its several architectures, andsvm, in its several variations, represent together a powerful set of tools widely used insolving prediction and clustering analysis tasks for data mining.2.2 process miningprocess mining (also known as workflow mining) is a relatively new research area thatlies between data mining and machine learning, on the one hand, and businessprocesses modeling and analysis, on the other hand (van der aalst, 2011).', 'its objectiveis to discover, monitor and improve real business processes through knowledgeextraction from event logs readily available in process-aware information systems(van der aalst, 2011).many process mining approaches currently use heuristic techniques andalgorithms; that is, “golden rules” based on assumptions about business processpatterns (van der aalst, 2011).', 'however,there are also some process miningapproaches that use computational intelligence techniques, including evolutionarycomputing and ann (tiwari and turner, 2008).', 'nevertheless, these computationalintelligence techniques are still in the minority in the process mining context whencompared to heuristics techniques and other techniques such as statistical techniques.although ann is one of the most widely used techniques in data mining, the slrpresented by tiwari and turner (2008), which provides a comparison of key researchefforts relating to process mining problems and techniques, with more than 50 papers,list only one study using ann.cbpmj21,613943.', 'methodologya systematic literature review (slr)is a means of identifying, evaluating, andinterpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, or topicarea, or phenomenon of interest (kitchenham, 2007).', 'individual studies contributing toa slr are called primary studies; a slr is a form of secondary study.', 'a slr differsfrom traditional reviews (such as simple literature reviews) and surveys withcomments made by domain experts because the experts use a replicable, scientific, andtransparent approach to avoid bias (biolchini et al., 2005).to conduct this slr, we used the guidelines by kitchenham (2007).', 'according tothese guidelines, a slr includes several steps, which can be grouped into three mainphases: planning the review; conducting the review; and reporting the review.', 'sections3.1 and 3.2 describe, respectively, details of the review planning and of the reviewconduction.', 'section 4 presents the review results.3.1 planning the slrthe planning of the slr includes the following steps: (i) identifying the need for areview; (ii) commissioning a review; (iii) specifying the research questions; fourth,developing a review protocol; and finally, evaluating the review protocol.', 'the followingsubsections details steps (i), since they are considered the main and mandatory steps ofthe review planning.3.1.1 need for a slr.', 'the authors of this paper are part of an interdisciplinaryresearch group in the area of information systems, which develops work in the datamining areas, mainly using computational intelligence and bpm techniques.', 'thereforethey are interested in conducting work in the area of process mining, usingcomputationalintelligence techniques and thereby understand and evaluate theprimary studies published within that context.considering that thus far no slr has been published for this purpose, these authorsdeemed important and useful undertaking such a review and consequently sharing itwith other potentially interested researchers.', 'this way other research groups can starttheir work from this review, saving research time and resources to focus on proposalsand evaluations of new approaches, using the existing works as a basis.', 'we chose theslr for this study because of its methodological benefits, as it maximizes thepossibility of recovering complete data sets, minimizing bias possibility.3.1.2 research questions.', 'assuming the need for a slr, we defined a set of specificresearch questions for this work.', 'these questions are mostly directed to discoveringhow certain computational intelligence techniques are applied in the process miningarea, aiming at a comprehensive understanding of this joint research area.', 'the mainpurpose of this study is to identify and assess such works that intend to use ann orsvm in the context of process mining:rq1.', 'what types of ann or svm are used to implement data mining tasks whenspecifically applied to the process mining context?for this question, we considered the following types of ann: first, in terms of the typeof architecture, which refers to how their processing units (neurons) are structured, thenetworks can be classified as feedforward single-layer, recurrent single-layer,feedforward multilayer, recurrent multilayer, and competitive layer (haykin, 2005);and second, with regards to the type of learning, which refers to the strategy used bythe algorithm to correct or approximate the mapping model or the decision surface thatcare being sought, the networks can be classified as supervised learning, unsupervisedlearning, reinforcement learning and fixed-weight networks (fausett, 1994).', 'in terms ofthe types of svm, we consider the basic model svm for classification (with supervisedlearning) and its two main variations support vector regression (svr) (with supervisedlearning) and support vector clustering (svc) (with unsupervised learning) (haykin,2005; cristianini and shawe-taylor, 2000):rq2.', 'which data mining tasks are addressed in process mining when applyingann andsupport vectormachines1395ann and svm?for this question, we considered the main data mining tasks (han and kamber, 2006):first, categorical prediction (or classification) – which consists of finding a function thatmaps (or classifies) a certain event (or fact) in a class (or category) from a finite andpredefined set of classes; second, numeric prediction (“regression” type) – which consistsof finding a function that approximately maps a particular event for a numeric value;third, numeric prediction (“trend identification” type) – involves a time component, thatis, it represents that specific class of problems for which they want to predict thebehavior or future value of a particular variable of interest based on previous values ofthis variable and possibly others; fourth, clustering analysis – consists of findingsimilarities between data to define a finite set of clustering data, organizing the data asclusters in order to maximize intra-cluster similarity and minimize intercluster similarity,or also to determine an unknown set of classes for the data in order to also describe them;and finally, frequent patterns discovery, association and correlation rules discovery –which consists of identifying frequent events which may be directly or indirectlyassociated (or correlated) with the occurrence of events or transactions:rq3.', 'what types of process mining are treated by ann and svm when thesetechniques are used to address data mining tasks in this context?for this question, we considered the following types of process mining: first,discovery – which refers to producing a still unknown business process model basedsolely on an event log, using no prior information; second, conformance – refers tocomparing a business process model already known as an event log of the samebusiness process in order to check whether the reality, as recorded in the log, is in linewith the business process model and vice versa; and finally, enhancement – refers tomodifying an existing business process model based on an event log of the samebusiness process in order to, for example, repair a process model so that it will betterachieve its purpose (van der aalst, 2011).3.1.3 slr protocol.', 'according to kitchenham (2007), a slr protocol specifies themethods to be used to undertake a specific review.', 'moreover, a pre-defined protocolis essential to reduce the possibility of research bias; it describes how to search andselect relevant primary studies and analyze the data extracted to answer thepredefined research questions.', 'the main components of a slr protocol include thedefinition of data sources; search strategy; primary study selection strategy;extraction method; and data summary.a.', 'data sources and search strategy.', 'we chose the following data sources to searchfor works in this slr: scopus[1] and isi web of science (wos)[2].',

and error.', 'for this classification, the svmclassifier is trained using preprocessing thatis also based on historical data,considering cases with known end result in terms of success or failure of

analysis on data streams: methodology andworkflow implementation in the clowdflows platform (2014).this work introduces a cloud-based scientific workflow platform, calledclowdflows, which is able to perform on-line dynamic adaptive sentiment analysisof microblogging posts (twitter posts).', 'the authors developed a web service that usesa svm algorithm to build and update sentiment analysis models and minimize theeffort required to apply labels to tweets.', 'for this purpose, the authors developed a webpage – called active learning workflow for sentiment analysis, in which the model wasperiodically updated and applied to new instance.', 'the main idea of the clowdflowsplatform is the workflow model that consists of an abstract representation ofworkflows and workflow components: the operation on the server is validated, and asuccess or error message with additional information is passed to the user interface.the platform has successfully passed the stress test, which means that it supportsmany concurrent users that continuously execute workflows.', 'the authors alsointended to show the adaptation of the clowdflows platform, enabling it to work onreal time data streams.', 'as a result, workflows in clowdflows are no longer limited tostatic data on the server but can connect to multiple data sources and can process thedata continuously.', 'although this work illustrates a reusable analysis model, which canhelp monitoring twitter sentiments in other areas, it does not represent a greatcontribution to the process mining area, since it focusses on the usability of thedeveloped platform instead of describing the workflow monitoring process.5.3 process mining – enhancement type( j-2) an intelligent production workflow mining system for continual

executionof process instances.', 'the evaluation and the quality of prediction allow includingimprovements in the actual manufacturing process.', 'differently from the study ( j-2),particularly in this case, a set of neural networks is required to evaluate the differentproperties in question.', 'thus, different regression models are generated, and a decisiontree helps in choosing which one to apply in each situation.', 'the results of this studydemonstrate, through a case study conducted in six months, that the proposedapproach enables to continuously analyze the problems monitored to achieve thequality improvement of the manufacturing process, optimizing it.(c-2) a fuzzy paradigm approach for business process intelligence (2006).this paper proposes the modeling of business processes based on fuzzy theory, alsowith supported by ann.', 'the authors propose a system that includes a soft computingmodule applied to the bpm context resulting in a system directed to the soft businessprocess intelligence.', 'the soft computing module supports the decision making basedon fuzzy rules which were extracted from a set of synthetic data generated based onrules and logic related to a process model taken from the context of bank business toprocess credit application.', 'the ann was used for extracting fuzzy rules.', 'thus, in thiscase process mining is used to automate the extraction of knowledge related to theprocess so that it can later be improved with the help of fuzzy rules.(c-3) process optimization of candy production based on data mining (2011).this paper presents a system to improve the candy production process,consequently increase the production efficiency and improve product quality.', 'in thissystem, ann is used to optimize the production process parameters.', 'however, theauthors do not explore in detail how the neural model was developed and tested,presenting only some information on the ann architecture and some results obtainedfrom the model application.', 'although the authors do not clearly describe how the logevents are used, there are explicit references to the existence and use of a datawarehouse created by the data collected from the candy production instance process.the data warehouse is configured as a data source for the optimization performed bythe ann, which makes decisions about improvements in the production processparameter, which must then be adjusted by human operators.( j-4) mining event logs to support workflow resource allocation (2012).this study uses svm to compare performance and classification results with othertechniques.', 'the overall objective of this study was to propose and validate a systemthat works as resource manager allocated to workflows.', 'the manager system ismodeled as a classification task and based on an “a priori” algorithm used to findfrequent patterns in workflow event logs.', 'the identified patterns are used to generateassociation rules, respecting the existing restrictions in the allocation of resources inthe workflow activities.', 'based on the association rules created by the algorithm, thesystem is able to classify resources for a new activity created in a workflow,automating the resource management task.', 'assuming that the system indicates thebest resource for a given situation, it is understood that this approach helps to improvecann andsupport vectormachines1407the workflow.', 'the approach was experimented, through data mining tools in weka,using the following classification algorithms: svm, c4.5, id3 and naïve bayes.the author’s approach, using association rules, achieved the best results with svm andc4.5 (with centesimal differences)in terms of classification accuracy.', 'however,a disadvantage reported for svm regards the mining time, that is, the time foroptimizing the svm decision model.(c-4) data mining for “big archives” analysis: a case study (2013).this work addresses archival analysis process (records reading, counting, sorting,assessing, searching and grouping) in order to improve it.', 'to achieve this goal, theauthors combine association rule mining and svm in an analysis procedure applied ina case study to address the formal records of communication (called state cables)between the us department of state and its embassies and consulates worldwide.', 'first,the study was aimed to classify the cables in order to arrange them in relation tosecurity classes.', 'such classification was time-dependent, as discovered by the authorsduring the tests carried out on the records collection.', 'the second phase of the studywas intended to describe the cables and how the relationship between the cables’content and their security classification changed over time.', 'the svm was applied inorder to infer the classifier for the first phase ofthe study.', 'different cablerepresentation models (i.e.', 'different combination of record descriptors) were tested andrequired a slide window representation of the time, since the classification behaviorwas dependent on the period when the cables were created.', 'the best accuracy reachedby the svm in this initiative was 92.39 percent, using a model representation for cablescomposed by information of subject and traffic analysis by geography and subject[4]and slide window representation.', 'the second phase of the study was implementedusing association rules discovery algorithms.6.', 'discussionbased on the information presented in the previous sections we conducted someanalyses, whose the results may be useful for the community of researchers interestedin using ann and svm to perform process mining.first, regarding the number of identified primary studies, there is still a limitednumber of studies being conducted with the goal of applying ann and svm in processmining.', 'considering that approximately 620 works were initially identified in the areaof process mining, the 11 final studies selected represent only about 2 percent of all thisentire area.', 'with respect to a possible trend regarding the distribution during the11-year period evaluated, as shown in figure 2, it appears that two-thirds of the studieswere published in the last four years, after a four-year period without any publication,which may indicate an apparent research retake and interest in this area.moreover, in the studies evaluated the authors usually report optimistic impressionsregarding the use of these techniques in the process mining context,includingreasonable numerical results, by supporting the production of useful knowledge forthe business areas involved in the studies.', 'however, considering the point of viewof the computational intelligence area, an analysis of the test and metrics strategies toevaluate the

concepts presented by this process mining expert.', 'forexample, only four of the 11 primary studies explicitly refer to the term process mining( j-4, j-5, c-1, c-2) and one of them explicitly refers

intensively only in the mid-1990s.', 'ann, however, has beenstudied since the 1940s, although for most of the 1950s it has received very littleattention from the academic environment.', 'given that svm became popular sorecently, it is quite normal that there is a gap in its use compared to ann in theapplication areas, including process mining, although the two techniques showsimilar results.(cid:129) as for the studies using ann, 71 percent use the feedforward multilayerarchitecture with supervised learning and only 29 percent use the competitivelayer architecture with unsupervised learning, and all with ann som.', 'the use ofthese types of ann is expected as they are the most popular in data mining,mainly due to their potential problem solving, thereby a greater availability ofcomputational tools to support the application.', 'however, the feedforward single-layer, recurrent single-layer and recurrent multilayer architecture types, and alsothe reinforcement learning and fixed-weight network types are not used in any ofthe studies.', 'this was also expected, since even in the data mining area in general,these types of ann appear less frequently, either because they are too simple andlimited – as the single-layer architecture, or because they are only suitable fortreating different types of problems – such as the reinforcement learning, highlyapplicable in simulators and robotics.(cid:129) as for the studies using svm, they all use the basic classification svm model(with supervised learning); that is, the variations svr and svc are not used inany study.', 'this is probably because ann is more popular, since svc and annare similarly applicable for clustering contexts, like svr and ann for regressioncontexts.', 'at any rate, considering a total of only 11 primary studies, the lack ofstudies that use svc and svr does not necessarily represent a pattern for theprocess mining area, but rather only an indicative.with regards to the data mining tasks being addressed in these process mining studieswhich use ann or svm, the data presented show that: 55 percent of the identifiedstudies address the categorical prediction task (or classification); 27 percent address thenumeric prediction task (considering the “regression” type); and 18 percent address theclustering analysis task.', 'the numeric prediction task regarding the “trendidentification” type is not referenced in any of the studies.', 'regarding the frequentpatterns discovery, association and correlation rules discovery tasks, two studiescomment on the resolution of such tasks within the scope of a more comprehensiveapproach, combined with categorical prediction (or classification) in one of the studies,and with clustering analysis in another study.', 'however, in those cases, this task is notdirectly linked to the activities that ann or svm resolve, therefore do not fall withinthe scope of this slr analysis.the cross-analysis presented in table xi and figure 3 showed that of the six studiesdealing with the categorical prediction task (or classification), four use svm, while onlytwo use ann.', 'as for the numeric prediction tasks (considering the “regression” type)all studies use ann.', 'given that svm is becoming increasingly popular and,traditionally, knowing the svc and svr variations occur only later, it is likely that thecann andsupport vectormachines1411studies in the process mining area also start using svc and svr, instead of ann, forthese two tasks which until now have been treated only with ann.', 'in general, svm hasoften proved to be superior to ann, considering the treatment of the structural risk,besides the empirical risk which generates potentially more accurate results thantreating only the empirical risk, as performed by ann.in general, approximately 80 percent of the primary studies evaluated in this slrshowed positive results, with process mining benefits such as increased productivityand efficiency in business processes.', 'however, not all these positive results can beattributed to the use of ann and svn, since most studies suggest hybrid approachesthat combine a series of different techniques and technologies.according to the evaluation of primary studies regarding their quality, as shown intable v, these studies were generally well evaluated, especially regarding the criteria“reporting” and “relevance”.', 'however, only papers published in the last three yearshave been completely well evaluated regarding most of the criteria, including also“rigor” and “credibility”, except for one study published in 2006, which in nearly all ofthe criteria were also highly rated.', 'the less recent papers refer to more basic studies,and which do not clearly present the application, testing and verification of the resultsachieved with the proposed approaches.', 'these concentrate most of the studiespublished in conference proceedings, which could somewhat explain the unfavorableevaluation in terms of quality.', 'furthermore, the older papers refer to the period whenprocess mining was still being disseminated, with research work still focussed onshowing its potential.', 'the good evaluation on the quality of the newly published worksshows that researchers are more concerned with the actual contribution of ann andsvm in the context of process mining.7.', 'validity threatsin order to avoid threats to construct validity (feldt and magazinius, 2010), the “processmining” and “workflow mining” terms were well established and are therefore sufficientlystable to be used as search strings.', 'similarly, “business process” and “workflow”, togetherwith “data mining” terms, were also well established.', 'another point is to ensurediscovering all the primary studies in the theme chosen.', 'for this purpose, two reputabledatabases were used, namely, scopus and isi wos.', 'together they index most of thepapers also indexed by other reputable databases, such as ieeexplore, acm digitallibrary, springerlink, sciencedirect and engineering village.as a threat to the internal validity (alves et al., 2010), some subjective decisions mayhave occurred during paper selection and data extraction since some primary studiesdid not provide a clear description or proper purposes and results, making difficult theobjective application of the inclusion/exclusion criteria or the impartial data extraction.to minimize selection and extraction systematic mistakes, several meetings were heldby the authors of this review work to discuss the type of proper treatment to theidentified conflicts.', 'in order to minimize internal validity threats regarding dataanalysis, this slr uses some descriptive statistics techniques, such as: graphs tosummarize data; tabular description; and, parametric description (average).regarding external validity (perry et al.', '2000; alves et al., 2010), we consider thatboth scientific and industrial communities in the bpm and data mining domains canbenefit from the results of this slr, and possibly the information systems andcomputational intelligence fields as a whole.', 'on the other hand, as a threat to externalvalidity, the scope of this slr might not generalize to broader study selections otherthan peer-reviewed papers, basically conference and journal papers.cbpmj21,61412in terms of reliability purpose (alves et al., 2010), we defined the search string andprocedures so that they could be directly and objectively replicated by other researchers.classification, however, is a source of reliability threat since evaluators inherently considersubjective factors during primary studies analysis, even if carried out by several evaluatorsin order to minimize distortions.', \"thus, there is no guarantee that other researchers couldachieve the same result as the primary studies classification presented herein.8.

that cochrane reviews are of highermethodological quality; [10] it is also important to iden-tify whether there are systematic differences in whereauthors choose to publish and the rationale for thesechoices.', 'as the methods for systematic reviews ofhealthcare interventions have become more mainstream,and increasing numbers of clinicians and researchershave been trained in these methods and

[http://www.cochrane.org/] was a pioneer in the area of evidence-based medicine.', 'established in 1993, it has been an ad-vocate for the conduct and dissemination of systematicreviews of evidence on, initially, healthcare interventionsand, more recently, in the area of diagnostic test accuracy.cochrane’s systematic reviews are published in the onlinecochrane database of systematic reviews (cdsr), one ofthe databases included in the cochrane library [http://www.cochranelibrary.com/].individuals interested in conducting a systematic re-view through cochrane are invited to register a title withone of 52 review groups which each focus on a specificarea of health (e.g., acute respiratory infections, backand neck, breast cancer, etc.)', '[1].', 'once the title is ap-proved, review teams comprised of at least two authorsprepare a protocol based on cochrane guidance [2].the protocol is submitted to the relevant review groupwhich manages peer-review and publication of the proto-col in the cdsr.', 'after approval of the protocol, authorscomplete the systematic review; this is also submitted tothe review group which manages peer-review and eventualpublication in the cdsr.', 'additional details on the processfor proposing and registering new reviews are availableonline [3].', 'the cochrane handbook provides detailedguidance for conducting systematic reviews; [2] further,cochrane’s central editorial unit [4] has established stan-dards for protocols, reviews, and updates of reviews whichare intended to guide the conduct and peer-review ofcochrane products [5].many systematic reviews are also conducted outside ofcochrane and published as technical reports by sponsor-ing agencies or in peer-reviewed medical journals.', 'manyinitiatives have emerged to increase the rigor of systematicreviews and transparency of reporting.', 'one key initiativeis the preferred reporting items for systematic reviewsand meta-analyses (prisma) [6].', 'prisma provides achecklist to help improve reporting by systematic re-view authors and is endorsed by a number of editorialorganizations and hundreds of journals [7].in addition to review groups, cochrane has networkspertaining to healthcare domains or populations of specialinterest [8].', 'these groups do not oversee the productionof systematic reviews; rather, their functions are to facili-tate linkages between cochrane and external stakeholders,disseminate results of cochrane reviews to the relevantstakeholders, and identify and tag titles, protocols, and re-views relevant to their scope [9].', 'they may also be in-volved in promoting the production of reviews, training,and conducting methodological research related to theproduction or dissemination of systematic reviews withintheir “field” or population of interest.cochrane child health is one such entity which wasestablished to ensure that the unique health needs ofchildren are reflected within the cochrane collabor-ation [http://www.cochrane.org/], [http://childhealth.co-chrane.org/].', 'the cochrane library is a key output ofcochrane and an important source of synthesized evi-dence to inform healthcare delivery; however, to be mostuseful, it needs to include evidence that is up-to-date,comprehensive, of high methodological quality, and rele-vant to specific populations such as children.', 'one cru-cial way of achieving this goal is to encourage authors ofsystematic reviews to publish their work in the cdsr.', 'ifauthors find it easier and more appealing to publishtheir work in non-cochrane arenas, this will dilute thecomprehensiveness and therefore usefulness and applic-ability of the cdsr.', 'furthermore, it will be more diffi-cult for clinicians and other decision-makers to quicklyfind relevant summarized data.end users looking for evidence in the form of system-atic reviews need to be aware that there are a vast num-ber of reviews published outside of cochrane.', 'previousresearch has shown that cochrane reviews are of highermethodological quality; [10] it is also important to iden-tify whether there are systematic differences in whereauthors choose to publish and the rationale for thesechoices.', 'as the methods for systematic reviews ofhealthcare interventions have become more mainstream,and increasing numbers of clinicians and researchershave been trained in these methods and have experiencecompleting systematic reviews, the facilitation providedby cochrane may be less sought after and instead theprocesses that occur during review development may beperceived as a hindrance to timely publication.chartling et al.', 'systematic reviews  (2016) 5:104 page 3 of 13our goal was to understand the motivations of system-atic reviewers for conducting and publishing their sys-tematic reviews either with cochrane (i.e., in the cdsr)or in other peer-reviewed journals.', 'to meet our goal, weconducted a survey of authors who have completed andpublished child-relevant systematic reviews with thecochrane collaboration and elsewhere in the medicalliterature to (1) understand their experiences in prepar-ing and publishing reviews and (2) identify factors thatinfluenced choice of publication venue.methodswe created a sample ofrecently published child-relevant systematic reviews.', 'we identified all completedsystematic reviews of healthcare interventions publishedin the cdsr for the most recent complete year prior toour study (2013; n = 145).', 'we felt that capturing reviewspublished during a complete year would provide a

ahrq-funded evidence-based practice cen-ters [5,6] exist.', 'even so, production is slow.', 'for example, tricco et al.[7] report that 19% of protocols published in the respected cochranelibrary fail to reach fruition as full reviews.', 'of those that are pub-lished as reviews, the average time to completion is 2.4 years witha reported maximum of 9 years, which is the ceiling imposed by thestudy design.', 'worse, these estimates ignore time spent exploringthe literature to assess signiﬁcance of possible review questions,and then time spent developing a protocol.a major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies.', 'ina two-step process involving independent and replicated effort,teammates ﬁrst identify provisionally eligible studies by readingtypically thousands of citations.', 'then they repeat the process byreading full texts of studies identiﬁed in the ﬁrst step to selectthe ﬁnal set of studies for inclusion in a review.', 'in other words,to be included in a review, a study must ﬁrst appear to meet eli-gibility criteria based on reading its citation; if so, it is eligible forfull-text review and provisionally eligible for inclusion in the sys-tematic review.', 'however, not until the full text of its report hasbeen carefully considered in light of the protocol is a ﬁnal decisionmade whether to include a study.in a best-case scenario, teammates compare their decisions andresolve their differences after each step, usually by discussion.', 'itis worth noting that screening procedures vary.', 'for example, somereview teams will consider a study for full-text review if at least oneteammate thinks the citation (title plus abstract) appears to meeteligibility criteria.', 'in contrast, other teams work to reach consensuswhen screening citations before they will consider a study worthreading as full text.', 'presumably, the latter procedure for screen-ing citations is more labor intensive.', 'the point is that workﬂowpatterns vary by review team and topic (a. mckibbon, phd, writ-ten communication, december 2010).', 'furthermore, it is likely thatestimates of workload for professional review teams associatedwith established centers are underestimates for inexperienced vol-unteer teams that may be conducting one-off reviews, e.g., whenlaunching new research programs.the research that serves as the foundation for this study wasconducted by aphinyanaphongs et al.', '[8], and later extended bykilicoglu et al.', '[9].', 'their work entailed supervised machine learn-ing methods and natural language processing to identify rigorousclinical trials in broad domains, such as therapy, rather than top-ical domains deﬁned by review questions.', 'based on the work ofhaynes and colleagues in a series of papers (e.g., see [10]), rigorwas presumed if trials comparing treatments were randomized andcontrolled.', 'however, identifying nonrandomized (nr) studies forinclusion in systematic reviews is an important problem becauserandomized controlled trials (rcts) may be unlikely or even uneth-ical for some research questions [11,12].', 'for example, nr studies,such as case-control, cross-sectional, and cohort studies, are com-monly employed to investigate exposure to environmental hazards,diagnostic test accuracy, disease etiology, human development,invasive surgery, adverse events, and rare disorders.', 'notably, inwhat is perhaps the ﬁrst study to use machine learning methods toidentify topically relevant trials for inclusion in systematic reviews,classiﬁcation involved randomized and controlled drug trials [13],which is in keeping with the foundational research of [8].for many review questions, the classiﬁcation task involves a mixof designs because reviewers search for nr studies (if eligible) inaddition to rcts.', 'the latter are preferred because they tend to beless biased relative to nr studies.', 'however, when nr studies areeligible for inclusion in a systematic review, the cochrane non-randomised studies methods group enjoins investigators to notinclude design terms in their search ﬁlters [12].', 'although ﬁltersexist to reliably retrieve rcts [14], ﬁlters “to identify other studytypes are limited” (appendix 2 in [15]; see also [11]).', 'this is trueeven though development of ﬁlters is ongoing (e.g., see [16–20]).thus, the initial screening phase can be more labor intensive whennr studies are eligible.', 'in response to this dilemma, some of thecochrane review groups allow nr design terms when the retrievalset is so large that the review becomes impractical (e.g., see [21]).if we take seriously the preference for not including design termsin searches for nr studies, an informatics solution to assist reviewteams seems especially warranted.researchers interested in [semi-]automating the screeningphase for systematic reviews are currently using the classiﬁerscomplement naïve bayes (cnb) [22] or a support vector machine(svm) with a linear kernel [23,24], or are developing a factorizedversion of cnb [25].', 'the fact that these researchers are using differ-ent classiﬁers for their speciﬁc tasks indicates that understandingrelative classiﬁer performance is a necessary step for our task.', 'thus,we are interested in empirically comparing the performance ofseveral supervised machine learning classiﬁers for a binary clas-siﬁcation task using biomedical citations from extant systematicreviews.', 'the task is binary because we want to classify primarystudies as being eligible or not for further consideration by thereview team.', 'we also consider no optimization vs. optimizationof features and parameters.', 'interestingly, a comparative study ofclassiﬁers by colas and brazdil [26] is sometimes cited as supportfor using a particular classiﬁer.', 'they found that an optimized k-nearest neighbor (k-nn) or naïve bayes (nb) classiﬁer could be asgood as a linear svm based on 20,000 newsgroup e-mails.', 'how-ever, they cautioned that their results should be validated for otherdocument classiﬁcation tasks to ensure generalizability.', 'in sum,classiﬁers useful for newsgroup e-mail may not be as useful forbiomedical citations.', 'thus, comparative studies of classiﬁers arewarranted.in general, our motivation for conducting this research is sim-ilar to that of other groups [13,22–25], i.e., we want to facilitateproduction of systematic reviews.', 'however, we are interested inassisting reviewers (regardless of experience or afﬁliation) by iden-tifying classiﬁers that can reduce the number of citations that mustbe screened during a second independent pass through a set ofcitations.', 'we interpret the usefulness of a classiﬁer with respect toreducing the number of citations to screen rather than time spentscreening because of differences in procedures, reviewer expertise,and number of teammates available for dividing the labor.', 'in otherwords, valid baseline estimates of time spent screening and subse-quent reductions in time depend on several variables that are notthe focus of this study.additionally, until this relatively new area of translational infor-matics research matures, we assume that reviewers will insist on atleast one complete cycle where human(s) screen the full set of cita-tions.', 'we further assume that a team consists of at least two peopleto ensure independent and replicated screening.', 'in reality, morethan one teammate can screen citations for the ﬁrst pass as long asother people independently screen the same citations during thesecond pass.', 'this procedure is meant to control random errors andbias introduced by humans.', 'however, there are times when eventwo people cannot independently screen the entire set of citations.when this is the case, cochrane suggests “a second person look at asample [emphasis added] of the records” [27].', 'this is precisely ourintention, i.e., we envision a machine learning system that returnsa reduced set or sample of citations to screen for the second pass.the reduced set would include most if not all of the citations labeledas eligible for full-text review, as well as a subset of those labeledas ineligible during the initial screening.', 'human reviewers wouldstill have to reach consensus regarding discrepant eligibility deci-sions from the ﬁrst pass through the entire set when comparedto a second pass through the reduced set (see fig.', '1).', 'assistingct.', 'bekhuis, d. demner-fushman / artiﬁcial intelligence in medicine 55 (2012) 197–207199fig.', '1.', 'machine learning can reduce the number of citations needed to screen by systematic reviewers.reviewers in this way would enable a more focused, independentscreening of citations during the second pass.', 'reviewer bias anderror would be controlled, in part, because of the opportunity for asecond screening by different teammate(s) who could potentiallyidentify studies overlooked by the ﬁrst reviewers.', 'furthermore, theworkload would be reduced because the disproportionately largeset of citations identiﬁed as ineligible by both humans and machinewould be eliminated from further consideration.in sum, we conducted this study to investigate whether (1)machine learning classiﬁers can help identify nr studies eligi-ble for full-text screening by systematic reviewers; (2) classiﬁerperformance varies with optimization of parameters and featuresextracted from biomedical citations; and (3) the number of citationsto screen can be reduced.', 'we did this by empirically compar-ing classiﬁer performance using citations that point to mostly nrstudies, varying optimization conditions, and then estimating thereduction in the number of citations to screen for the best classiﬁer.2.', 'methodsthe citations for this study were from 2 cochrane systematicreviews.', 'one has to do with surgical interventions for treatingameloblastomas of the jaws [21] and the other with vaccinesfor preventing inﬂuenza in the elderly [28].', 'by using citationsfrom extant systematic reviews, we capitalized on domain-speciﬁcknowledge.', 'this is because citations were initially retrieved bycochrane trials search coordinators who developed ﬁlters givenreviewers’ knowledge of their topics.for the ameloblastoma dataset, we had access to the entire setof citations (n = 1815) retrieved from medline [29], embase [30],the cochrane central register of controlled trials, and the cochraneoral health group trials register.', 'for the inﬂuenza dataset, weretrieved 5485 citations (94%) by re-running published medlineand embase searches.', 'we also manually searched for 147 studiesnot in our retrieval set, but listed in the review as eligible for furtherconsideration.we managed citations in endnote and recorded decisions aseither exclude or

number of citationsto screen.we conducted this study in two phases.', 'phase i involved nei-ther optimization nor validation; phase ii involved optimizationof features and classiﬁer parameters with cross-validation.', 'in bothphases, we conducted independent tests on the reserved data.we deﬁned best models as returning highest recall with preci-sion good enough to reduce workload.', 'speciﬁcally, recall had to beat least 95% and precision had to be greater than 7% and 6% for theameloblastoma and inﬂuenza datasets, respectively.', 'the rationalefor the cutoffs is as follows: when a model returns nearly perfectrecall but poor precision, almost all of the eligible studies are iden-tiﬁed along with many falsely identiﬁed ones.', 'in the extreme, ifprecision equals the percentage eligible, the returned set of studiesis as large as the entire set and no reduction in workload is possible.thus, precision must surpass the percentage of studies identiﬁedby humans as being eligible for full-text review.', 'note that whenrecall is 95%, the machine falsely excludes 5% of the eligible stud-ies.', 'however, in comparing discrepant decisions, human(s) wouldreconsider the 5% they had identiﬁed but the machine had missed.in our experiments, we compared the following classiﬁers: k-nn[26], nb [40], cnb [41], and evolutionary support vector machine(evosvm) [42].', 'nb and cnb are probabilistic learners; evosvm isfunctional; and k-nn is a lazy learner that classiﬁes based on sim-ilarity or distance measures.', 'further, nb assumes conditional andpositional independence of features; thus, the immediate contextof features or processed words extracted from citations is ignored.cnb is suitable for imbalanced data and presumably more appro-priate for this task because the percentage of eligible studies insystematic reviews is usually relatively small.', 'additionally, cnbrelaxes the particularly unrealistic assumptions of nb regardingindependence of features extracted from text written by humans.evosvm uses a kernel function to ﬁnd a nonlinear hyperplane thatmaximally separates classes of documents.', 'evosvm generalizessupport vector machine classiﬁers and can optimize non-positivesemi-deﬁnite kernel functions [42].we used rapidminer default settings for classiﬁer parameterswith the following exceptions: for evosvm, we set c = 1 instead ofc = 0 in phase i

(f3), which is a weightedharmonic mean ([35], p.144).', 'the formula for f is:f = (beta2 + 1)precision × recallbeta2 × precision + recall(1)where beta is a non-negative number.', 'note that the

complementary approach also mitigates poten-tial bias from the sample of literature used for text mining,which may only help identify more of the same literature.there seems to be a paucity of published literature on text‐mining procedures for identifying free‐text and controlledterms for specific databases using generic tools, althougheunethta13 and gourlay14 provide some guidance onobtaining term frequencies.', 'controlled vocabularies can alsobe analysed using database specific tools, particularly formedline and pubmed, and these are listed elsewhere.2,15however, there is little guidance on using the variety of textmining tools available to complement other methods toidentify search terms for undertaking systematic reviews.the aims of this paper are to (1) give an overview of themain applications of text mining for search term develop-ment; (2) reflect on the usefulness of some technologiesthrough a case study and further examples; and (3) discussthe challenges in using these tools.', 'we hope this will promotefurther debate and dissemination of techniques and methods.2 | an overview ofapplications of text miningfor search term developmentthe purpose of this section is to provide an overview of themain applications of text mining for search term develop-ment.', 'to do this, examples of the application of text miningfor search term development in reviews were identified fromthe following sources: items screened for a systematic reviewon text mining for screening16; focused iterative searches ofgoogle and google scholar; citation searches of literaturefound; browsing the repository srtoolbox.com; and discus-sion groups, such as the cochrane information retrievalmethods group.the types of applications identified for text mining forsearch

screening within an integratedcstansfield et al.3system; and using text mining as the predominant method for“objective searches.” objective searches are outside of ourfocus here and are described by hausner et al.6,17,18text mining can be used to increase the sensitivity of asearch by identifying more words, word forms, or phrases,to broaden the range of studies that contain relevantrecords.5,7,21 this might be targeted on certain elements ofthe search, for example, damarell et al21 identified potentialsearch terms in the titles and abstracts from records onlyretrieved by a database's controlled vocabulary and not byknown free‐text terms.the precision of a search can be improved by identifyingphrases or combinations of words rather than a single wordon its own, such as thompson et al,19 or by identifyingthemes of unwanted items through automated clustering.20for aiding translation across databases, damarell et al21used text mining to capture items from pubmed not indexedwith controlled medical subject headings; however, thiscould have wider applications in assisting development ofsearch strategies across other databases.\", 'the reverse of thisapproach is also used where citations identified fromsearches of free‐text fields in a database are analysed for suit-able controlled vocabularies.mergel et al22 describe slrqub, as a proof of concept, asa tool to

usefulness of some technologies beyond those identifiedin the case study above through some further examples.5.1 | increasing precision of the search bycombining multiple toolswhen refining the search for a review of self‐care and minorailments,1 we needed to capture studies investigating primarycare consultations but reduce the number of irrelevant studiesthat would be found from only searching on the term“primary care.” we analysed a sample of 54 records usingthe concordance tool antconc, which revealed the moreprecise phrases such as “primary care practice,” “primarycare consultancies,” “primary care centres,” “gp‐supervised,”and “gp appointment.” the final search included these termsin close proximity with one another.in a separate analysis for the same review, we analysedpreliminary medline search results that were limited to onepublication year to investigate the presence of themes thatwere inadvertently captured by the search.', 'lingo3g cluster-ing of 428 items revealed a cluster “cancer” (which was outof scope for the search), and we identified that this was beinglocated owing to terms for “pain management” and “paincontrol.” we next used some additional tools to examinethe results of a subsequent search and analysis of 410 itemsfrom that year, which revealed other terms relating to “pain.”using a function in voyant tools entitled “documentfrequencies tool,” we noticed that the word “pain” appearedfrequently in relation to “chronic pain,” “chronic back,” and“chronic musculoskeletal.” an analysis of mesh terms inendnote revealed “chronic disease” and “chronic pain” inmany items.', 'bibexcel was used to discover that the word“pain” was in nearly a quarter of the records, and the word“chronic” was in a sixth of the sample.',

search was clustered using lingo3g to assess dom-inant themes from the records located by the search strategy.this generated 29 clusters; cluster labels that were clearlyrecognisable as not within scope included “total kneearthroplasty,” “total hip arthroplasty,” and “hip arthoscopy,”which are types of surgical procedures, and “rheumatoidarthritis.” by comparison, a tf‐idf analysis showed thatthe first mention of “arthroplasty” was ranked 84th in the listof terms.', 'exploring the clusters led to the discovery that“arthroplasty” was mentioned in nearly a fifth of citationsfrom the test search.', 'the final search was adjusted to reducethe number of unwanted items about surgery and postopera-tive recovery by excluding items containing surgery and post-operative recovery in their titles from the part of the searchrelating to osteoarthritis and excluding surgery subheadingsfrom the controlled vocabulary searches.', 'we did not adjustthe search terms to exclude for rheumatoid arthritis althoughsome of these would have been reduced through reducing thenumber of citations on surgery.in a different systematic review concerning medicationerrors in children,34 a test search in pubmed yielding 5757citations was clustered into groups using lingo3g.', 'thisresulted in 28 clusters, and of these, several clusters werelabelled with themes that were not included within the scopeof the review: “suicide attempts,” “pregnant women,” “illicitdrugs,” and “heroin overdose.” citations were browsedwithin some of the clusters, and term searches were also usedto indicate how much literature there was on a topic on, forexample, “pharmacy,” “parents,” “suicide,” “traffic,” and“driving.” as a result, some elements were identified thatcould be potentially excluded from the search, with care notto exclude relevant items at the same time.', 'these excludedelements related to street drugs, alcohol behaviour, suicide,accidents while driving, and pregnancy.it was previously reported that clustering was used on aset of records retrieved from a preliminary test search inpubmed relating to the late diagnosis of many health condi-tions.20 this identified a dominant theme that was not withinthe focus of the review (the genetic technique of polymerasechain reaction) and an amended search strategy thataccounted for this theme reduced the number of recordsretrieved from the pubmed search by 4% (over 500 records).cstansfield et al.7the amendment was also applied to databases searches ofpsycinfo and cinahl.', 'a conservative estimate suggeststhat the additional pubmed records would have taken abouthalf a day for one person to screen, representing a consider-able workload saving (and having 2 people check recordsindependently would double this estimate).6 | discussionwe now summarise the potential utility and challenges inusing these technologies for search term development.', 'inparticular, we consider combining tf‐idf and termine;compare word frequency and concordance tools; discuss theusefulness of clustering approaches; provide a brief descrip-tion of visualisation and synonym tools; suggest samplingas a particular challenge in applying the tools; discuss consid-erations in using the tools; and consider potential limitationsof this work.6.1 | the value of combining tf‐idf analysisand terminein the case study on the care and support of older people withintellectual disabilities, tf‐idf analysis and termine wereboth found to be beneficial in identifying terms for one searchconcept (related to ageing).', 'however, as each had differingresults, their use is complementary to one another.', 'unliketf‐idf, the termine point of speech (pos) parsers are notintended to identify every word; in our example, the genie2.1 pos used here did not recognise phrases for older peopleor the term menopause.', 'with the tf‐idf analysis, someterms of interest were either missed owing to parsing somephrases as single words, because the word was not significantin the body of text analysed.', 'for both termine and tf‐idf,the manual process of scanning the term lists has potentialto miss items through a user either by not recognising termsor phrase fragments as significant or by not scanning thelower‐ranked terms in the list.', \"however, missing terms canbe partly mitigated by iteratively using a technique ofsearching for citations not located by the search terms andreanalysing successive citations.o'mara‐eves et al5 observed that a small challenge isdeciding on the threshold below which terms identified bytermine would not be considered, and they used a thresholdc‐value of 5 when analysing the full text of 5 papers.\", 'theirrationale was that “it was the common value below whichmined terms seemed to lose relevance across the five papers”(p. 53).', 'such thresholds are ultimately subjective and cannotbe standardised across reviews, as terms with lower rankingsmight be relevant in some instances because the distributionof c‐value scores returned will differfrom corpus tocorpus.', 'for the review about self‐care of minor ailments(richardson et al.,1), termine was applied to 51 title andabstract citations, initially using a threshold c‐value of 5,which identified 22 citations; but then relevant terms thatlocated more records were identified by those with a c‐valuebetween 2 and 5, identifying 40 out of 50 citations.', 'with thistechnique, the c‐value threshold used is less important as thisis not the sole method for generating search terms.6.2 | comparison of word frequency andconcordance toolsbibexcel was particularly useful for obtaining the frequencyof citations that contain particular words that were indicativeof citations that were not of interest.', 'a tool to analyse phrasesgiving the frequency per citation would have been better, hadwe wanted to consider this further.', 'this is possible withantconc, which has more functionality than bibexcel foranalysing words in text.', 'we have shown that antconc canprovide more informative analysis of assessing phrases andcolocated words within a specified distance of each other.6.3 | the usefulness of clustering approachesclustering can generate groups of citations rapidly.', 'it drawsupon the most dominant themes depending on the uniformityof the discriminating terms.', 'clustering is not as useful in abody of literature where the terms are interconnected or thereis no dominant vocabulary to express a collection ofunwanted (or wanted) items, as shown in the case study onolder people with intellectual disabilities.', 'however, in theother examples described, there were clear dominant themesthat were unrelated to the area of interest, and these couldbe identified and attempts made to address this in the searchstrategy.', 'from these experiences, we conclude that it is diffi-cult to predict in advance when clustering might be useful.we previously observed that 2 hierarchical tiers of clus-ters to be better than one tier for exploring themes in thedataset, as this provided better differentiation of topics.20however,in obtaining an overview of the literature forassessing the performance of the search strategy, it can beuseful to have both single and 2 tiers of clusters to explore,as the single tiered clusters allow the collection of citationswithin an overarching cluster label to be observed.within a clustering algorithm, there are 2 separate pro-cesses.', 'the main process is core clustering, which is typicallya mathematical analysis of the distribution of terms.', 'the sec-ond process is finding a good label to describe the clusters.the lingo3g algorithm has addressed both these aspects,but when evaluating the utility of a given clustering solution,it is important to bear in mind that both are being evaluated atonce.', 'otherlatentdirichlet allocation may identify more coherent clusters thanlingo3g (ie, are better at finding the similarities betweenalgorithmsclusteringsuchasc8stansfield et al.groups of citations), but as they do not identify simple labels—but offer ordered lists of terms—significant user interpre-tation is needed to identify why particular groups of citationshave been put together.306.4 | visualisation toolsit is possible to link the output of text mining to visualisationtools, such as word clouds.', 'while this may provide a quickoverview and have visual appeal, it is unclear how thesecould offer more meaningful information than a ranked listof terms or phrases.', 'for example, when words are presentedat different angles and in a range of colours, it could be easyto miss some important words.', 'however, this might improvewith development and integration with other tools.', 'thecirrus word cloud tool allows user control of the number ofhighest frequency words that are displayed, offering someflexibility of appearance.', 'some visualisation tools, such asvos‐viewer, can show keyword cooccurrence networks,where the distance between 2 terms provides an indicationof the number of cooccurrences.35 as such, it may reveal pos-sible areas of citations containing unwanted items in a search.for example, glanville36 showed that the word “recruitment”was presentin a search sample in conjunction with theseparate concepts of clinical trials and molecular biology.and examples described here, the samples of studies werecollected to increase sensitivity for selected topics that weredifficult to describe, and they were not intended to identifyall of the search terms.', 'the quantity of citations collectedfor the sample was arbitrary, although the samples wereintended to comprise of a range of relevant concepts.', 'if textmining is being used to refine a search, perhaps to revealunwanted items in a collection of research for the purposeof increasing precision,the sample might simply be thecitations (or subset, or specific timeframe of citations) froma test search strategy or a search line within a search strategy.the data included in sample are also important to con-sider.', \"in the examples here, citations and abstracts were used;however, o'mara‐eves et al5 used the full‐text of 5 papersthat were seminal within the area of their search focus.\", 'insome cases, the use of full‐texts may not always be possible(for example, limitations in the software, or a lack of knownrelevant studies) or it might be too inefficient to make theprocess worthwhile, given that retrieving and then the pro-cessing the full‐text documents may add considerable time.whether better quality information can be gleaned fromabstracts versus full texts is unknown but is dependent onthe breadth and depth of relevant terms used in each, whichcannot be known in advance and willlikely vary fromcitation to citation, and review to review.6.5 | synonym tools6.7 | considerations in using the toolsdistinct from these tools are other tools that rely on anexternal corpus of literature to provide relevant terms (by“external corpus,” we mean a corpus of studies outside ofthe review).', 'a noticeable absence from the literature con-cerns tools that identify synonyms or homonyms, particularlyoutside the medical literature; such tools rely on an externalcorpus.', \"for example, nactem's history of medicinesemantic search system includes synonyms and a range ofother semantically related medical terms,37 drawing on 2archives of historical medical text.\", 'such tools have the poten-tial to provide a more objective perspective of appropriatesearch terms within an area, beyond those obtained from auser‐derived sample.6.6 | sampling as a particular challenge inapplying the toolsa key challenge is using a suitable sample of studies to ana-lyse.', 'careful consideration is needed to avoid introducingselection bias.', 'if the purpose of text mining is either toincrease sensitivity or ensure that the search is of a good stan-dard, there is potential for this process to instigate a situationwhereby the sample used may only reveal more of the same,or what one expects to be there, because of the way thesample was collected in the first place.', 'in the case studywhere text mining is applied to a collection of citations andabstracts, it is particularly useful to understand how manycitations relate to a given term, to indicate the relative impactof a term in locating the items from a search.', 'without know-ing how many terms a given citation is responsible for gener-ating,the terms from long citations or documents withrepeating words may be overrepresented within a sampleand appear high in a ranked list, even though they might onlyrelate to one citation.', 'in using the above tools to improveprecision, rapidly generating this information from bibexceland endnote helped inform whether it was worth spendingtime exploring specific words in the search.the text mining tools and techniques used here wereapplied quickly, with the bulk of the time spent on analysingthe results.', 'the iterative process of developing the searchstrategies took time, as they had particular challenges inachieving a search that balanced sensitivity and precision.using text mining tools alongside other methods for searchterm development requires additional time input, although itis difficult to quantify how much additional effort is involved.partly, this depends on the complexity of the search task andthe extent of text mining undertaken.', 'related to this isjudging how best to use the tools for a particular purposeand when to stop developing the search.', 'the time requiredfor both will vary depending on the familiarity of the usercstansfield et al.9with the tools and approaches used.', 'however, the additionaltime has potential to improve the quality of the search andpotentially reduce the volume of records retrieved—thussaving time further into the review process.althoughthis wasfor most tools used, an element of preprocessing of thecitations within a reference management tool was needed toanalyse specific citation fields (such as titles, abstracts, andkeywords);somefamiliarisation with the process was needed.', 'if we wantedto find out how many citations in a sample a term relatedto, some tools (for example, termine) required multiplesteps, such as combining the tool with citation or reviewmanagement software to “search within” to obtain the rele-vant citations.onerous,notthe process of generating terms from a prepared sampleusing termine or tf‐idf analysis takes less than a minuteand little learning time on its use is required.', 'a drawbackof antconc is that additional processing is required to sepa-rate records into citations,38 accessibility can be hamperedby institutional firewalls, and some learning on how to usethe tool is necessary.', 'in comparison, bibexcel was quickerto apply, although more time was initially needed to under-stand and develop the steps to use bibexcel because it is amultifunctional tool (gourlay14 was a helpful starting point).also, bibexcel has less functionality as a concordance tool.the voyant tools were accessible and rapid to use throughtheir web interface, although some functions do not facilitateunderstanding how many citations relate to a term, withoutusing citation or review management software to “searchwithin” for that term.in terms of costs, it would be useful to undertake a fulleconomic analysis of this part of the systematic reviewworkflow, although careful prospective design would beneeded to capture the necessary information.', 'shemilt et al39undertook a cost‐effectiveness analysis of the title‐abstractscreening stage of a systematic review but did not examinethe impact of different methodologies for constructing theinitial search.', 'unlike the screening stage of the review, searchstrategy design is an iterative process, influenced by humanknowledge and skills, and may be approached in a varietyof ways depending on the purpose and resources of a review;these issues would need to be carefully considered in aneconomic evaluation.6.8 | potential limitations of this workwe have not investigated how the use of these tools mightinteract with, or be supplanted by, emerging tools and meth-odologies for using machine learning in the citation screeningprocess.', 'for example, we have described above how tools canbe used iteratively to improve the precision of a search byidentifying terms and concepts that lie outside the scope ofa review.', 'it may be, however, that the process of “activelearning,” whereby the machine is able to “learn” to distin-guish between relevance and irrelevance would result in amachine learning model that identifies irrelevant terms auto-matically; thus, the incremental time saved in reducing thesearch yield

tantalizing, and potentially possible, idea; how-ever, to date, no direct fall prevention algorithms have yetbeen demonstrated.', 'the existing studies along this lineof research are comprised mainly of gait assessment andpre-emptive in-home fall-prevention training exercises,and while gait-based and pre-emptive exercise methodsare, at best, only indirectly related to true fall preventionmethodologies, they nonetheless have strong potential tocontribute to the enabling of accurate fall detection andprevention in the future.gait assessment to reduce fall eventsthe studies in this section represent differing approachesin current kinect-based automated gait assessmentmethodology research.', 'stone and skubic [23,24] con-ducted a comparison of the kinect with a ground-truthvicon system.', 'gabel et al.', '[25] and parajuli et al.', '[26]each separately demonstrated that a wide range of full-body biomechanical parameters, such as core posture orangular velocities of limbs, were accurately acquirableusing the kinect.', 'stone and skubic [23,24] also per-formed a successful real-world pilot study of their auto-mated gait analysis system in a functional assisted livingfacility.stone and skubic [24] collected and compared gaitrelated data using the kinect, a dual web-camera sys-tem, and a ground-truth vicon motion capture system.not only was the kinect reported to have sufficient accu-racy for clinical gait assessment, it provided significantimprovements in foreground capture and overall compu-tational requirements when compared to the low-cost webcamera system.gabel et al.', '[25] developed a method of full bodygait analysis through the use of kinect-based data and amultiple additive regression tree algorithm [51,52].', 'thesystem monitored the time of the stride, stance, andswing phases of a gait cycle, as well as angular veloci-ties of arm movements; however, measurements of lowerlimb angular velocities and core

coefficient of angular velocity readingsbetween the kinect and a gyroscope of greater than 0.91for both arms.', 'furthering these findings, parajuli et al.[26] demonstrated that variables of kinect-based postureand gait recognition can also be accurately acquired (upto 99%) through the use of the specific biomechanic andalgorithmic parameters of: height/shoulder width, arms’coordinates, and c-support vector machine scaling (for anoptimal hyper-plane [53]).translating kinect-based gait assessment applicationfrom only system accuracy and biomechanic parameterreadings to real-world

hardware, estab-lishing the limitations of the sensor within specific appli-cation scenarios is an ongoing process.', 'nevertheless, weprovide a list of current limitations of kinect that wenoted based on our review of applications in elderly caresystems.1.', 'current kinect-based fall risk reduction strategiesare derived from gait-based, early interventionmethodologies and thus are only indirectly related totrue fall prevention which would require some formof feedback prior to a detected potential fall event.2.', 'occlusion in fall detection algorithms, while partiallyaccounted for through the methodologies of thevarious systems discussed, is still a major challengeinherent in kinect-based fall detection systems.current strategies focus on a subject who stands, sits,and falls in

kinect sensor must be fixed to a specific locationand has a range of capture of roughly ten meters.this limitation dictates that fall events must occurdirectly in front of the sensor’s physical

kinect, and when placed under scrutiny, thekinect has been found, in general, to carry significantpotential for a cost-effective motion capture system forrehabilitation.', 'chang et al.', '[27] and loconsole et al.', '[30]specifically examined accuracy of kinect in recordingupper extremity movements, whereas a whole-body pos-tural evaluation approach was taken by clark et al.', '[28],fern et

al.', '[30] leverageda setup containing real, rather than solely virtual, objects,and while some accuracy variation in all joint trajectorieswas noted depending on the object’s distances on the zaxis (towards the object from the camera) and x axis (hor-izontal, sideways from the camera), all tests - includingthose for the shoulder joint trajectories - resulted in read-ings of within 2 cm of the correct/baseline values.', 'thiswas reported as well within the limits of rehabilitationneeds.', 'chang et al.', '[27]; however, observed acceptablewrist and elbow joint tracking, but the shoulder trajec-tory readings were found to be widely inconsistent.', 'theauthors attribute these inconsistencies to differing meth-ods of motion capture and joint estimation between theground-truth optitrack system and the kinect.', 'on theother hand, even with these inconsistencies, when par-ticipants were asked to utilize external rotation of theshoulder during game play, the system successfully iden-tified all non-external rotation movements performed asincorrect.clark et al.', '[28], obdrzálek et al.', '[29], and fern et al.[31] concluded that, in general, the kinect has sufficientaccuracy for the assessment of whole-body kinematicsfor postural control and diagnostic purposes.', 'the notableissues of concern with regards to kinect-based accuracyvalues between these three studies ultimately related toone of two things: self-occlusion errors (which can becaused by the angle between a participant and the sensor,specific movements such as placing a hand on one’s lum-bar spine, or when the scene contained non-participantobjects such as wheelchairs or walkers) or proportionalbiases which, when observed, always occurred in com-plex embedded systems such as the pelvis, sternum orshoulders.in order to simplify the method of verifying the kinect’saccuracy for rehabilitation and to avoid the influenceof various errors introduced by human biomechanics,pedro et al.', '[32] utilized a ‘points of interest’ approachcwebster and celik journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation 2014, 11:108http://www.jneuroengrehab.com/content/11/1/108page 16 of 24rather than a whole-body kinematic analysis.', 'under thismethodology, the kinect readings had good repeatabilityin both x and y axes, whereas repeatability worsened asthe distance to the ‘point of interest’ (z axis) increased.data gathered in this study showed that the average of thestandard deviation of spatial error increased quadraticallywith distance; however, even with this limitation it wasnoted that the kinect retained a sufficient level of accu-racy at manufacturer recommended distances for use inrehabilitation applications.in an attempt to further improve accuracy of kinect,including lessening occlusion error or enhancing finemotor control capture, the use of the kinect together withvarious inertial sensors has sparked interest.', 'hussain et al.[63] made use of kinect-monitored manipulation of spe-cially designed intelligent objects (i.e a can, a jar, and akey-like object embedded with inertial sensors) for finemotor control diagnostics of the hand and wrist.', 'thisallows for a virtual environment to monitor the locationand kinematics of both the user and the objects manip-ulated by the user.', 'a variety of hand-held objects verysimilar if not identical to those

occlusion, or non-participant objectinterference.', 'when compensation for this deficiencyis required for more specific applications, skeletizationbased on a fusion of kinect-gathered and worn

available,as a method of inertial sensor calibration, and inertial sen-sor estimations when kinect readings are unavailable dueto occlusion.kinect-based rehabilitation methodsthe ultimate goals of

disabled participants who did not desire to get upand walk toward a computer screen.', 'furthermore, a com-pletely home-based system, as described by maggioriniet al.', '[54], would be ideal for a game-based exercise andrehabilitation paradigm.gerling et al.', '[85] conducted two studies to examinethe use of kinect as a human-computer interface forolder adults.', 'in the first study, an evaluation of elderlyparticipants’ performance using a set of gestures devel-oped with the aid of a physical therapist was performed.based on the resulting limitations observed in movementpatterns, an exergame was designed targeting institu-tionalized elderly participants.', 'the second study theninvestigated how participants responded to the derivedgame-based gestures, and concluded that kinect-basedgaming has a positive effect on users emotional well being.sun et al.', '[86] developed a kinect-based exergame whichallowed players to participate in interactive balance exer-cises with visual feedback, and explored how kinect-basedbalance training exercises influence the balance controlability and the tolerable intensity level of a player.', 'thegame would move various body-outline shapes toward theplayer’s avatar, and the player would then have to imi-tate the body-outline shape in order to pass through itwithout touching the outline.', 'as differing player expe-rience evaluation methods resulted in different findings,it was concluded that care must be taken while decid-ing on which evaluation methods are to be employedwithin game design.', 'chiang et al.', '[87]

requirements, can be summarized as thefollowing:1.', 'any games designed specifically for diagnostic usageare limited to non-occluding movements.', 'thisimplies that standard stroke impairment level testsrequiring extensive occluding movement sets may beuntenable for a kinect-based system to capture.2.', 'diagnostic potential for extremities is limited to grossmovements, as fine movements of the

compensation).4.', 'appropriate response to failure and poorperformance, if not accounted for during gamedesign, can inherently limit positive outcomes due todemotivation/discouragement resulting in lessfrequent/consistent use of the system.5.', 'the current benefits of kinect-based gaming haveonly tentatively been studied with mainly short termand small sample sized studies.', 'data to date shouldbe seen as initial results, and not normative.discussionas kinect-based elderly care and stroke rehabilitationresearch is in its infancy, a majority of the data acquired isqualitative with a focus on self-report and personal opin-ion.', 'compounded with this observation is the fact that thedata is derived only from small groups of participants, itis anything but normative and should be viewed as tenta-tive initial results.', 'filling the deficiencies of quantitativeand large population based research thus remains a poten-tially fruitful and necessary avenue of future work.', 'thecurrent applications of kinect in elderly care seem to beat a more mature state than those of stroke rehabilita-tion; however, even with the current deficiency, we believethat the kinect carries the potential to become a futurecornerstone of widely dispersed care and rehabilitationsystems.with regards to fall detection and fall risk reductionapplications, each of the current technologies of panicbuttons, audio sensors, body-fixed systems, 2d and 3dvideo capture systems comes with inherent physical andfinancial limitations.', 'while the kinect does not renderany of these technologies obsolete, and comes with itsown limitations, its unique aspects may enhance currentsystems, or potentially be the foundation for newly devel-oped functionalities.1.', 'the autonomous nature of the kinect allows for falldetection without requiring a user to physicallytrigger a panic button system, or the wearing ofcumbersome physical devices, which can often beforgotten.2.', 'the kinect comes with built in directional soundcapture capabilities, possibly enabling it to be used as,or in unison with, current audio sensor-basedsystems.', 'this is a functionality of the kinect not yetstudied.3.', 'the added third dimension depth field measurementoffered by the kinect requires less overhead thancurrent methodologies, and enables the developmentof more accurate methods of fall-related imageprocessing to be developed.4.', 'the low-cost, marker-less, and widely dispersiblenature of an already commercially available gamingsystem immediately enables the current clinicalvirtual reality-based rehabilitation methodologies tobe rapidly relocated to individual home settings.while questions such as participants with what level ofimpairment most strongly benefit from using the kinect,how to build an ideal exercise routine for preventative orrehabilitation needs, which is the most performant falldetection algorithm, or how to most efficiently leverageall the various capabilities of the kinect are still unan-swered, the overarching conclusions of this review pointtoward the kinect as a promising technology for a widerange of elderly care and stroke rehabilitation applicationsand need for studies involving larger participant pools toestablish reliability and validity.remarks and suggestions for future workwe have compiled the following list based on our reviewof the current state of kinect-related elderly care andstroke rehabilitation literature.', 'it contains our remarks aswell as suggestions for relevant future research.1.', 'a majority of applications in elderly care and strokerehabilitation require a robust and easilymanipulated user interface which at present cannotbe readily found in current commercial systems.when developing exercise games, serious games, andapplications of kinect-based rehabilitation, it isvitally important to remember that repurposing atechnology initially intended for a younger andhealthier audience requires careful adherence to newdesign strategies focused on both the physiologicaland psychological requirements of aging and injuredusers.', 'therefore we suggest that multidisciplinaryresearch teams involving engineers as well asclinicians, human factors experts and cognitivepsychologists would be best positioned to tackle thechallenges that such game development effortswould entail.cwebster and celik journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation 2014, 11:108http://www.jneuroengrehab.com/content/11/1/108page 21 of 242.', 'a critical validation step for

of gait assessment andpre-emptive in-home fall-prevention training exercises,and while gait-based and pre-emptive exercise methodsare, at best, only indirectly related to true fall

this section represent differing approachesin current kinect-based automated gait assessmentmethodology research.', 'stone and skubic [23,24] con-ducted a comparison of the kinect with a

was the kinect reported to have sufficient accu-racy for clinical gait assessment, it provided significantimprovements in foreground capture and overall compu-tational requirements when compared to

for the assessment of whole-body kinematicsfor postural control and diagnostic purposes.', 'the notableissues of concern with regards to kinect-based accuracyvalues between these three studies ultimately related toone of two things: self-occlusion errors (which can becaused by the angle between a participant and the sensor,specific movements such as placing a hand on one’s lum-bar spine, or when the scene contained non-participantobjects such as wheelchairs or walkers) or proportionalbiases which, when observed, always occurred in com-plex embedded systems such as the pelvis, sternum

scopus publications(1/6)(http://www.webometrics.info/en/node/19, december21, 2013).current international ranking systems thus use a varietyof factors in their calculations, including web presence,number of publications, citations to publications, and peerjudgments (aguillo, bar-ilan, levene, & ortega, 2010).despite typically reﬂecting a combination of differentfactors, as shown earlier, and with different objectives, theytend to give similar rankings.', 'this suggests that universitiesproducing good research also tend to have an extensive webpresence, perform well on teaching-related indicators, andattract many citations.', 'any new website that attempts to bea general resource for academics, such as researchgate,therefore raises the possibility that statistics derived fromit could be used for a new ranking scheme for academicinstitutions.', 'nevertheless, even the top institutions varybetween ranking schemes, suggesting that there are sub-stantial differences between the schemes.', 'for example, ukuniversities seem to perform particularly wellin thequacquarelli symonds (qs) world university rankings,which relies heavily on international peerjudgmentsbut the questionnaires for these had higher rates of return inthe usa and uk than elsewhere, at least in 2008 (huang,2012).', 'similarly, ranking systems that rely on bibliometricdatabases can sufferfrom language and internationalbiases (archambault, vignola-gagné, côté, larivière, &gingras, 2006; van leeuwen, moed, tijssen, visser, & vanraan, 2001) and the results can be misleading if thedata are not properly cleaned or ﬁeld-normalized.', 'perhapsmostthe concept of rankings foruniversities is probably ﬂawed in itself.', 'it may be reason-able to rank universities on speciﬁc, narrowly deﬁnedaspects of their goals, as the cwts indicators do tosome extent, but any general ranking must necessarilybe based on a series of simplifying assumptions and heu-ristics, such as the percentages given to each categorymaking up an indicator, and so the results should only betaken as very approximate even if the methods used areessentially sound.', 'perhaps university ranking schemessurvive because they are useful marketing tools for univer-sities that perform well in them, with the marketers whouse them not being as concerned with their validity aswould bibliometricians.important, however,country rankings and international comparisonsit is important to assess the international uptake of newscience-related websites, like researchgate, in order toappreciate their reach and to assess whether they are beingvirtually ignored in any part of the globe.', 'for this, it is usefulto start with existing academic country rankings as bench-marks.', 'although less visible than institutional rankings,journal of the association for information science and technology—(cid:129)(cid:129) 2014doi: 10.1002/asi3cthere are some attempts to rank countries based on theirscientiﬁc production (leydesdorff, 2012).', 'such rankingscan help to identify the relative success of different nationsand countries that are increasing or decreasing their scien-tiﬁc success relative to other countries.', 'this can aid policy-making because individual nations can use rankings to judgethe success or failure of their policy initiatives or to judgeglobal trends (zhou & leydesdorff, 2006).', 'rankings can bebased on total productivity in a particular database or canbe based on citations in a bibliometric database and may belimited to a particular ﬁeld (hu & rousseau, 2009) or can begeneral.', 'similar techniques can also be used to comparespeciﬁc nations (kostoff, 2008) or sets of nations (hu &rousseau, 2009).academic social network sites and altmetricsalthough academics can use institutional or subjectrepositories to list or store their publications or may list andlink to them from a traditional web cv, publications can alsobe listed or hosted in social websites (allen et al., 2013; masbleda et al., 2014).', 'the ﬁrst social websites supportingauthors to list their references were online reference man-agers like mendeley (henning & reichelt, 2008), zotero(ritterbusha, 2007), citeulike (bogers & bosch, 2008),and connotea (hull, pettifer, & kell, 2008).', 'although origi-nally intended as sites for students and academics to list andshare their references, they incorporated social networkingfeatures and a logical extension was to allow users to list andpromote their own publications as part of a personal homep-age.', 'from the perspective of self-publicity, the main differ-ence now with academic social network sites is perhaps oneof emphasis because sites like adacemia.edu and research-gate appear to be primarily spaces for academics to describethemselves and their works and to connect with others.', 'amore fundamental difference is that adacemia.edu andresearchgate currently do not have reference-sharingfunctionalities.a by-product of academic use of the social web is that itis possible to identify statistics about the popularity of indi-vidual articles within social websites, which has led to thecreation of new online indicators for article impact and theemergence of the ﬁeld of altmetrics (priem, taraborelli,groth, & neylon, 2011) to study them.', 'while several yearsare needed to gauge the citation impact of an article, count-ing the number of tweets (eysenbach, 2011) or blogs(shema, bar-ilan, & thelwall, in press) mentioning it cangive an early indication of its likely eventual citation impactand most altmetric studies have focused on evaluating themor interpreting them for sets of articles (sud & thelwall,2014; thelwall, tsou, weingart, holmberg, & haustein,2013), although not always with positive results (e.g.,haustein, peters, sugimoto, thelwall, & larivière, in press).altmetrics can also give evidence of different aspects of theimpact of an article compared to traditional citations(thelwall, haustein, larivière, & sugimoto, 2013).', 'forexample, although the number of readers of mendeleyarticles correlates with their citations, mendeley readers arelikely to reﬂect more educational impact than do citations(bar-ilan et al., 2012; li, thelwall, & giustini, 2012;mohammadi & thelwall, in press).', 'the impact of an aca-demic within academia.edu seems not to correlate with theirofﬂine impact, however, perhaps because more senior aca-demics are less likely to list all their publications in the site(thelwall & kousha, in press).few altmetrics have been used to rank institutions orcountries because they are typically most easily availablefor individual articles and the metadata for individualarticles may not contain author institutional afﬁliationorcountry location information.', 'academia.edu andresearchgate do not have this problem, however, becauseauthors are naturally organized into institutions in bothsites.', 'in addition, researchgate presents a ranked list ofinstitutions on its website (https://www.researchgate.net/institutions/), although this does not appear to be widelypublicized.no previous research has investigated altmetrics derivedfrom researchgate.', 'there are ﬁve different logical sourcesof such altmetrics.(cid:129) total publications: the number of publications listed by anacademic in their proﬁle.', 'this can be aggregated by institu-tion (or country) to give an academic scholarly output indi-cator for the quantity rather than the quality, value, or impactof the listed outputs.', 'at the institutional level it would beaffected by the extent to which scholars joined researchgateand populated their proﬁles as well as the size of the institu-tion.', 'in addition, it would be affected by ﬁeld norms in thequantity of outputs produced, especially if an institution hadlarge departments in areas with particularly high or lowaverage numbers of outputs per researcher.(cid:129) total impact points: the cumulative journal impact factors ofthe publications of an academic.', 'aggregated by institution (orcountry) the results reﬂect a combination of quantity and(journal-based) citation impact.', 'this seems to be a betterinstitutional research quality indicator than total publications,although it suffers from all of the same limitations as well assome additional problems of the journalimpact factor.perhaps most signiﬁcantly, the raw impact points are notﬁeld-normalized and so would advantage institutions special-izing in areas with a high citation impact and disadvantageinstitutions specializing in low citation impact areas, such asthe arts and humanities.(cid:129) downloads: the total number of downloads recorded byresearchgate for the full-text articles uploaded to author pro-ﬁles.', 'aggregated by academic, institution, or country, theresults would indicate the extent of readership for the article(s)concerned.', 'although reading an article does not equate to thearticle having an impact, it is nevertheless reasonable to con-sider download counts as a type of impact indicator because itseems likely that extensively read articles will have had animpact in some way, such as within science, education, orapplications.', 'in addition to having the same problems as totalpublications, downloads are probably higher in ﬁelds with alarge undergraduate student audience for research.', 'downloadsprobably also tend to be higher in ﬁelds in which open accesspublishing is common and readers do not have access to the4journal of the

the total number of views recorded by researchgatefor the meta-data of articles.', 'aggregated by academic, insti-tution, or country, the results would indicate the extent ofinterest for the article(s) concerned and would probably cor-relate highly with download counts, when full-text articleswere available on the site.', 'the biases are probably similar tothose for downloads, although perhaps less substantial forarticles with full text easily available in other places.(cid:129) rg score: this is a number for each academic and institutioncalculated by researchgate using an algorithm that is notfully disclosed but which is based on contributions tomembers’ researchgate proﬁles,interactions with othermembers, and reputation among other members.', 'this presum-ably includes components from the above four indicators andhence shares their limitations.', 'in addition, its activity compo-nent gives a large bias towards academics and institutions thatemploy researchgate the most, making it a hybrid scholarlyachievements and site use indicator.research questionsthe dual purposes of this article are to assess whetherresearchgate statistics reﬂect existing academic hierar-chies, in the sense that they can give plausible rankings ofinstitutions, and whether leading science nations are unequalin their uptake of the site.', 'the ﬁrst research question isimportant not only to investigate the use of researchgatebut also because one ranking is already published byresearchgate and others can be relatively easily calculatedand so their possible meanings should be assessed.', 'thesecond research question is based on the assumption that theuse of researchgate should be approximately proportionalto the amount of research conducted by a country, and so anydiscrepancies between researchgate indicators and nationalscience rankings would suggest relatively high or lowuptake for the site within any given country.', 'assuming thatresearchgate use is valuable for scientists, which isunproven, the results would point to countries that are likelyto beneﬁt from, or lose out from, the site.rq1: do researchgate indicators give similar rankings

more downloads than views in some casesas well as values that were too large to be credible, suggest-ing large-scale systematic activities.', 'as a result, the statisticsabout the top three countries

correlations for both researchgate views and down-loads, despite being arguably more direct indicators of thevalue of an individual document, suggest that these statisticsare a somewhat skewed reﬂection of the articles’ academicimpact.', 'for instance, they may reﬂect educational impactrather than academic impact, may be too low (particularlyfor older articles) to give the statistic sufﬁcient statisticalpower, or perhaps many downloads and views are created bystudents from the same institution out of curiosity.', 'similarly,the researchgate score, which incorporates both impact andactivity, had low correlations, suggesting that there was nota strong association between the most active members ofresearchgate and membership ofthe highest-rankinginstitutions.in general, the correlations between the researchgatescores and the academic rankings are lower than thosebetween the rankings themselves.', 'the highest of the former,0.612 between total impact points and arwu rankings, ishigher than the correlations between the cwts rankingsand three of the other rankings, however.', 'overall, while thethe and arwu rankings are the most similar to each other,total impact points, the cwts ranking, the qs ranking, andthe webometrics ranking do not stand out as anomalouslydifferent from each other.', 'the averages of the correlationsbetween each system and the other ﬁve systems are: totalimpact points 0.514; cwts 0.531; qs 0.556; webometrics0.568; the 0.648; arwu 0.668.some of the correlation differences in table 1 could bedue to the different sample sizes,

highest ranked universities) would be higher thancorrelations based on larger numbers (which would includemore lower-ranked universities).', 'to test for this, table 2reports the correlations for the 74 institutions with exactrankings reported by all of the systems (i.e., excluding allinstitutions for which at least one of the systems did notreport an exact rank).', 'the total impact points again

downloads by the number of documents, and divid-ing impact scores and rg scores by the number ofmembers.', 'with such normalizations,the correlations intables 1 and 2 decrease.', 'for member normalization, this ispresumably because a higher proportion of researchers or agreater numbers of students join from more successful uni-versities.', 'for document normalization, this is presumablybecause the volume of publishing is part of the reason forthe success of universities,than primarily theaverage quality of each publication.', 'figures 1 and 2 illus-trate the relationship between the raw indicators with thehighest correlation (researchgate impact points and theawru scores underlying the awru rankings) andthe same for the size-normalized version of the impactpoints indicator.', 'the main difference may be just a singlepoint, rockefeller university, which had only 328researchgate members and specializes in biological sci-ences and medical science research (it was the rockefellerinstitute for medical research until 1965).', 'its status as anoutlier in figure 2 is probably due to its specialization inhigh-impact research areas and its relatively small size.', 'incontrast, the apparent outlier status of the university ofwashington in figure 1 may be due to a combination of itslarge size, successful medical school (medicine is a high-impact research area), and perhaps also extensive use ofresearchgate.', 'the relatively low researchgate scores inboth ﬁgures for harvard, in contrast, could be due to itsmore balanced portfolio and perhaps a lower uptake ofresearchgate (for figure 1).', 'perhaps the most importantimplications for the use of any researchgate indicator forranking is therefore that size and ﬁeld normalization areessential (despite the lower correlations found after nor-malization) in order to get any kind of reasonable indica-tors of an aspect of science performance, assuming thatthis is desirable.to check that there were different levels of uptake ofresearchgate between institutions, the number of research-gate publications for 258 of the top institutions was dividedby their number of publications in the wos 2006–13

reported earlier carry no evidence ofcausation.', 'hence, it has not been demonstrated that an insti-tution is likely to have high values of researchgate statisticsbecause of its high academic status since unanalyzedfactors, such as institutional size, may relate to both.', 'inparticular,the researchgate metrics with the highestcorrelations with the existing rankings were not normalizedfor institutional size and it seems intuitively that this isunfair.10journal of the association for information science and technology—(cid:129)(cid:129) 2014doi:

of the association for information science and technology—(cid:129)(cid:129) 2014doi: 10.1002/asi11canother limitation is that the top institutions seem todominate researchgate currently, and so the ﬁndings maynot apply to typical universities.', 'for example, out of all10,653 institutions crawled that had a threshold of at least 10members and 10 publications, the researchgate sites of the200 top universities listed in the times ranking (2%) accountfor 19% of the members and 31% of the publications.', 'aconsequence of this is that high-quality papers are probablyoverrepresented on researchgate, similar to the case foropen access articles in general, as mentioned earlier (craiget al., 2007).although the data show that existing institutional rankingsmostly have a medium or large positive correlation withvarious researchgate statistics, the results do not demon-strate that use of researchgate would be advantageous toresearchers.', 'even though the site aims to help researcherscommunicate with each other and disseminate their publica-tions, the correlations found do not show whether this issuccessful.', 'in particular, there are no ﬁndings about the extentto which researchgate helps individual academics or theirpublications to gain visibility or impact.', 'moreover, doubtabout the efﬁcacy of open access publication in general(gaulé & maystre, 2011; craig et al., 2007) increases theuncertainty about the value of researchgate.', 'related to this,and in support of researchgate acting as a preprint archive, innovember 2013 there were a few citations to publicationswith researchgate urls in both scopus (50) and googlescholar (630).', 'this is a tiny number compared to the numberof citations to the arxiv.org e-print archive, which has over25,000 citations from scopus publications.', 'these ﬁgures arenot comparable, however, because arxiv.org is older and isexplicitly for prepublication articles, whereas researchgatedoes not play the role of an accepted preprint archive for anyscholarly community.', 'presumably, most articles found inresearchgate would not be cited with researchgate urlsbut with postpublication information (e.g., journal or confer-ence name), and so it seems likely that researchgate is muchmore useful for ﬁnding publications than the two url citingstatistics suggest.the six ranking schemes analyzed here (i.e., research-gate impact points plus the ﬁve established rankings) do notattempt to rank institutions based on the same properties,such as research success, but all have different implicit orexplicit goals.', 'out of all of them, researchgate impactpoints and the cwts rankings give the purest reﬂection ofresearch impact, with the latter being size-normalized andﬁeld-normalized and hence giving a much fairer researchranking.', 'nevertheless, these two have the lowest correlationof all of the six ranking schemes.', 'this suggests that thecorrelation between researchgate impact points and theother schemes could be mainly due to factors other thanaverage research performance, such as institutional size.another factor might be reputation, assuming that universi-ties are more highly ranked by systems other than the cwtsrankings if they publish extensively in high-impact areas,such as medicine.', \"for example,the top institution inresearchgate for impact points, the university of washing-ton at seattle (cwts rank 27), has 13% of its impact pointsfrom its department of medicine, despite this departmentcontaining only 2% of its researchgate members.']\", None, None, None, None,

should be considered safe andready for use in ‘live’ reviews.', 'the use of text mining as a ‘second screener’ may also be used cautiously.', 'the use of textmining to eliminate studies automatically should be considered promising, but not yet fully proven.', 'in highly technical/clinical areas, it may be used with a high degree of confidence; but more developmental and evaluative work isneeded in

findings from multiple studies in a reliableway and are often used to inform policy and practice,such as guideline development [1,2].', 'whilst they areoften associated with medical research and randomisedcontrolled trials, they can be used to address any re-search question using any relevant type of research [3].a critical feature of a systematic review is the applicationof scientific methods to uncover and minimise bias anderror in the selection and treatment of studies [4,5].however, the large and growing number of publishedstudies, and their increasing rate of publication, makesthe task of identifying relevant studies in an unbiasedway both complex and time consuming [6].in order to minimise the impact of publication bias[7], reviewers make efforts to identify all relevant re-search for inclusion in systematic reviews.', 'this has al-ways been a challenging and time-consuming aspect ofreviewing, but the challenge is growing due to the in-crease in the number of databases to search and thenumber of papers and journals being published; more-over, as recent work has suggested that there is an in-built north american bias in many major bibliographicdatabases (e.g.', 'pubmed), a wide range of smaller databasesneeds to be searched in order to identify research for re-views that aim to maximise external validity [8].', 'in prac-tice, this means adopting a multi-layered approach tosearching which combines: extensive boolean searches ofelectronic bibliographic databases, specialised registersand websites; with individual approaches to authors andkey informants; and the following of ‘citation trails’ (iden-tifying which papers are cited by a relevant study andwhich papers in turn cite the paper that it is reported in)[9].', 'of these three approaches, searching databases yieldsaround three quarters of the studies finally included [10].unfortunately, the specificity of sensitive electronicsearches of bibliographic databases is low (for definitionsof specificity, recall and other key metrics, see table 1).reviewers often need to look manually through manythousands of irrelevant titles and abstracts in order toidentify the much smaller number of relevant ones [7]; aprocess known as screening.', 'reviews that address com-plex health issues or that deal with a range of interven-tions (e.g.', 'a typical public health review might beconcerned with ‘interventions to promote physical ac-tivity’) are often those that have the most challengingnumbers of items to screen.', 'given that an experiencedreviewer can take between 30 seconds and several mi-nutes to evaluate a citation [11], the work involved inscreening 10,000 citations is considerable (and thescreening burden in some reviews is considerably higherthan this) (see also [12]).reviewers are thus faced with two competing demands.reviews that are to be used to inform policy and practiceoften need to be completed to externally defined (oftenshort) timetables within limited budgets; but in order for areview to be an accurate reflection of the state of know-ledge in a given area, it needs to be comprehensive.the need to complete reviews to tight timescales hasled (particularly in health technology assessments andother rapid reviews) to the adoption of highly pragmatic(and relatively specific) strategies to searching in order tolimit the number of studies to screen—even though rele-vant research is probably missed because of this [16].limiting the recall of a search may undermine one ofthe most important principles of a systematic review:that its results are based on an unbiased set of studies.the key problem—which this paper aims to begin to ad-dress—is that there are currently no widely accepted al-ternative ways of dealing with this issue.', 'reviews are atrisk of either limiting their searches to such a degreethat the validity of their findings is questionable or of in-creasing the time and resources they require and thusrisk being unable to inform policy and practice.proposed ‘solution’: the (semi)-automation of screeningbroadly speaking, text mining is defined as the processof discovering knowledge and structure from unstruc-tured data (i.e., text) [17,18].', 'in the context of finding re-search for inclusion in a review, we are interested inautomated techniques of discovering whether a givenstudy (described by a title and abstract) is relevant toour review [19,20].', 'there are two ways of using textmining that are particularly promising for assisting withscreening in systematic reviews: one aims to prioritisethe list of items for manual screening so that the studiesat the top of the list are those that are most likely to berelevant; the second method uses the manually assignedinclude/exclude categories of studies in order to ‘learn’ toapply such categorisations automatically [19]; whilst thetechnologies to perform each may be similar, we separatethem here as they are conceptually distinct.', 'the prioritisa-tion of relevant items may not appear to reduce workload(if all citations are to be screened manually anyway), butwhen there are large numbers of studies to screen manu-ally, identifying most of the relevant ones quickly enablessome members of a reviewing team to begin the nextstages of the review, whilst the remainder of mostly irrele-vant citations are screened by other team members.', 'thisreduces the time from review commencement to comple-tion, even if the total workload remains the same.by reducing the burden of screening in reviews,

mining to the screen-ing stage of systematic reviews has intuitive appeal, there areobvious concerns that might be raised by the systematic re-view community [21].', 'firstly, there is not a lot of informa-tion abouttext mining written for systematic reviewaudiences.', 'the vast majority of papers on this topic are pro-duced by computer scientists in journals and conferenceproceedings in the field of medical informatics or artificialintelligence.', 'this means that they are not particularly ac-cessible to systematic reviewers who need to make decisionsabout their review processes, both in terms of the level oftechnical detail presented in the reports and in the exposuresuch papers would have in systematic review communities.secondly, for these technologies to achieve broad up-take, they should be accessible to systematic reviewerswithout the need for a computer scientist to write be-spoke code or undertake custom processing of text forindividual reviews.', 'specialist advice may be required,but it should be akin to the need for occasional special-ist statistical advice, rather than being at the level of op-erating the text mining tools.', 'any implementationissues need to be identified and resolved before rollingsuch technologies out to the intended users.thirdly, there are various ways in which workloadcould be reduced through these technologies (reducingnumber needed to screen;text mining as a secondscreener;increasing the rate (speed) of screening andimproving workflow through screening prioritisation).however, not all technologies allow all types of workloadreduction to be achieved.', 'in order to make informed de-cisions about using such technologies, systematic re-viewers need to know which technologies can be usedfor which workload reduction goal.fourthly, systematic reviews are a relatively new area inwhich text mining technologies have been applied.', 'some ofthe assumptions of text mining technologies in other appli-cations do not hold when transferred to the review context.for instance, systematic reviewers generally place strong em-phasis on high recall—that is, a desire to identify all the rele-vant includable studies—even if that means a vast number ofirrelevant studies need to be considered to find them.', 'whenapplied in other areas, precision (reducing the number of ir-relevant items) and accuracy (correctly classifying items asrelevant or irrelevant) are typically more valued.', 'to be ac-ceptable to the systematic review community, new technolo-gies must address the particular challenges and demands ofthis context (we should also note at this point that we haveno guarantee of perfect recall even with current methods, assearch strategies are tailored to the resource available toscreen results, and humans are likely to make mistakes dur-ing their manual sifting through records.', ').finally, the methods, their relative success and themetrics used to evaluate them have not yet been pulledtogether

best.', ').workload reduction approachesin this section, we address research question 2: whatare the stated purposes of (semi-)automating the screen-ing stage through text mining in terms of workload re-duction, and what types of methods have been used toaddress each purpose?it is evident from the literature that there are severalpossible ways to reduce screening workload.', 'the ap-proaches that have received attention in terms of textmining are: reducing the number of items that need tobe screened manually; reducing the number of peopleneeded to screen the items;increasing the rate (orspeed) of screening; and improving workflow.', 'table 2shows the number of studies that implicitly or explicitlyaddressed each of these approaches.', 'each of these willbe discussed in turn.reducing the number of items that need to be screenedin many reviews, the number of items to be screened isvery large.', 'for example, 4 out of the 31 cochrane col-laboration systematic reviews published in march 2014had over 10,000 items to screen [26-29].', 'this can be aparticular problem for searches for certain types of studydesigns, such as is the case with searches for non-randomised controlled trials, for which database filtersare not available or consistently used [30].', 'large num-bers of items to screen is even more evident in non-clinical disciplines, in which search strategies tend to bebroader in response to broader research questions, lessprecise or consistent terminology and the lack of con-trolled vocabularies; for example, eppi-centre reviewson topics in public health, education and social careregularly exceed 20,000 items to be screened.', 'at its mostextreme, one review identified upward of 800,000 itemsand another over 1 million items to be screened (see[31] for a description of such ‘extreme reviewing’).', 'giventhat an experienced reviewer can take between 30 sec-onds and several minutes to evaluate a citation [11], thework involved in screening even as ‘few’ as several thou-sand citations is considerable.an obvious solution to reducing workload is thereforeto reduce the number of items that need to be screenedmanually.', 'historically, the volume of records returnedfrom a search was determined in part through the searchstrategy: the number of records identified could be re-duced either through searching fewer sources or throughcarefully constructed database queries.', 'the latter ap-proach usually adopted an emphasis on the precision ofthe search overrecall.', 'however, some methoditsco’mara-eves et al.', 'systematic reviews 2015,

institute of medicine of the nationalacademies [32,33]).therefore, resource-efficient approaches that maximiserecall are needed, and a number of different models havebeen identified here.', 'the vast

approach to workload reduction,so column total is greater than 44 studies.12approaches to excluding items from a review.', 'the firstapproach is to use a classifier that makes explicit in/out decisions; 23 studies evaluated this approach[11,14,23,25,34-51].', 'the second approach is to use aranking or prioritisation system and then exclude itemsthat fall below some threshold or criterion,

confidence in how likely anitem is to be an include or exclude (akin to the rankingin the second approach), this is usually ‘hidden’ fromthe reviewer such that the decisions are presented ascomplete.', 'in contrast, the second approach may re-quire a reviewer to continue manual screening untilthe (reviewer-specified) criterion is met.it is important to note that the final approach, activelearning, can fit loosely into both of the abovementionedcamps.', 'active learning (evaluated in nine studies[11,23,25,31,40,45,48,49,58]) is an iterative process wherebythe accuracy of the predictions made by the machine is im-proved through interaction with reviewers.', 'the re-viewer—or review team—provides an initial sample ofthe machine ‘learns’include/exclude decisions thatco’mara-eves et al.', 'systematic reviews 2015, 4:5http://www.systematicreviewsjournal.com/content/4/1/5page 8 of 22from; the machine subsequently generates a ranked listand requests the reviewer to provide decisions on itemshigh in the list that it will learn the most from.', 'the ma-chine adapts its decision rule including the informationfrom the additional items and generates a new list ofitems for the reviewer to screen.', 'this process continues,with the number of reviewer decisions growing and agreater number of relevant items found than wouldotherwise be the case, until a given stopping criterion isreached and the process ends.', 'although the final in-clude/exclude decisions for any items not screenedmanually come from the classifier, the human screenerstill has some control over the training process and thepoint at which manual screening ceases.in all cases, authors reported that the systems tested ledto a reduction in workload; however, given the diversity ofapproaches and the lack of overlap (replication) betweenevaluations, it is impossible to conclude whether one ap-proach is better than the other in terms of performance.typical performance reported a reduction in manualscreening workload from less than 10% (e.g.', '[41]) up tomore than 90% (e.g.', '[48]).', 'where expressed as a work-load reduction, studies tended to report reductions ofbetween approximately 40% and 50% of work saved (e.g.[25,40,41,55]).', 'studies differed from one another interms of the recall that they aimed for.', 'some expressedresults in terms of 95% recall (e.g.', '[23]), whereas othersexpressed their results in terms of retrieving all relevantstudies (e.g.', '[48]).', 'razavi and colleagues took a criticalperspective with regard to manual decisions too, con-cluding that ‘since the machine learning prediction per-formance is generally on the same level as the humanprediction performance, using the described system willlead to significant workload reduction for the humanexperts involved in the systematic review process’ [44].text mining as a second screenermethods guidance for conducting systematic reviewsoften suggests that more than one person should screenall (or some proportion) of the records returned by thesearches (e.g., the institute of medicine (washington,dc) states in standard 3.3.3.', '‘use two or more membersof the review team, working independently, to screenand select studies’ [33]).', 'the rationale behind this ap-proach is that a single screener can inadvertently intro-duce bias into the study selection process either becauseof their interpretation of the inclusion criteria or throughtheir understanding of the content of titles and abstracts.moreover, given the volume of records to be reviewed, itis conceivable that some relevant records might ‘slipthrough the net’.', 'it is believed that if there is consistencyin the inclusion decisions amongst two or more independ-ent screeners, then the screening process is not likely tobe biased.', 'this, however, becomes a very labour-intensiveprocess—particularly when the number of records toscreen is high.', 'although some guidance suggests that ifsufficient inter-reviewer reliability is achieved that it is ac-ceptable to ‘double screen’ only a proportion of the re-cords when there is a large number to screen, this still canadd a substantial amount of resource to an already time-consuming procedure.to combat this workload issue, six papers have advo-cated the use of text mining as a second screener: re-placing or supplementing the additional human reviewerthat would be required at this stage [24,30,59-62].', 'in thismodel, one human reviewer screens all of the recordsand the machine acts as the independent check (or pre-sents a vastly reduced list of items to be screened to anadditional human reviewer).', 'the evaluations of workloadreduction in this area have all been on a classifier model,in which explicit in/out decisions are made by the ma-chine.', 'results from the evaluations are positive—the clas-sifiers had good agreement with the human reviewer/s.three of these papers were authored by bekhuis and col-leagues [30,59,60], who report that their approach couldreduce manual workload by between 88% and 98% [60].frunza and colleagues report two studies in this area[24,61] and garcia one study [62].', 'like bekhuis, they re-port positive results from their evaluations, though theypresent their findings in terms of high recall rather thanworkload reduction, and so a direct comparison cannotbe made.increasing the rate of screeningan alternative approach to those above, which empha-sises reducing the number ofitems that need to bescreened manually, is to aid researchers in coming to adecision about each item more quickly; that is, to in-crease the rate of screening.', 'to achieve this, visual datamining (vdm) approaches attempt to create a visualrepresentation of the connections between documents(using term similarity and/or author connections) to as-sist the screener in identifying studies easily that aremore likely to be similar to each other.', 'thus, once arelevant document is identified, they can quickly scanother documents that appear to be similar to the rele-vant document (and similarly, identify documents thatare likely to be excluded quickly).', 'the approach assumesthat humans can make a decision about a study’s rele-vance faster using this additional visual information thanrelying on the textual information in the titles and ab-stracts alone [13].five evaluations of visual data mining were identifiedin the field of software engineering.[13,14,63-65], allthe evaluations of visual data mining differ from evalua-tions of other text mining approaches in that they em-ploy a controlled trial evaluation design to compare thespeed and accuracy with which a human can screenco’mara-eves et al.', 'systematic reviews 2015,

accuracy of the human screenersdoes not appear to change substantially [13,14,63-65].a second approach to speeding up the rate of screen-ing that is embedded within approaches to reducing thenumber needed to screen is through efficient citation as-signment.', 'the only example that was identified of thistype was by wallace and colleagues [49].', 'in that paper,the authors emphasise that most review teams have acombination of expert and novice screeners.', 'within thecontext of an active learning approach, they developed analgorithm that incorporates both information about therelevance of each item and the expected time that it willtake to annotate that item; on that basis, the algorithm se-lects citations specifically for expert and novice reviewersto label.', 'the authors reported that this approach enabledmore items to be screened in the same amount of timecompared with typical active learning approaches.improving workflow efficiency through screeningprioritisationscreening prioritisation is ultimately a form of efficient cit-ation assignment, in that it aims to present reviewers withan ordered list of the items, with the items that are mostlikely to be relevant to their review at the top of the list.however, it differs from the model described by wallaceet al.', '[49] in that it is not necessarily embedded within anapproach that is attempting to reduce the number neededto screen and it does not differentially assign items to dif-ferent types of reviewers (i.e., experts versus novices).there are various proposed benefits of this approachto workflow efficiency.', 'one is that reviewers gain a bet-ter understanding of the inclusion criteria earlier in theprocess, as they encounter more examples of relevantstudies sooner than would otherwise be the case.', 'it alsoenables the retrieval of the full text of documents tostart sooner than can occur when citations are screenedessentially at random.', 'this can be important, as obtain-ing the full-text reports brings forward their full-textscreening, the checking of their bibliographies and, crit-ically, enables contact to be made with study authorsmuch earlier in the review.', 'it is also possible that thiswill make the screening process faster, once the vast ma-jority of relevant studies are identified, as the screenersbecome more confident that items later in the list areless likely to be relevant.', 'this could also help with theproblem of over-inclusiveness that is often experiencedin reviews, in which reviewers tend to be cautious andinclude many more items at this early stage than ultim-ately make it into the review.cohen highlighted another potential benefit: ‘in reviewswith searches that result in a large number of citations tobe screened for retrieval, reviewing the documents inorder of their likely importance would be particularly use-ful.', 'the remainder of the citations could be screened overthe following months, perhaps by the members of theteam with less experience, whilst the work of reviewingthe includable studies is ongoing’ ([66] p. 692) (an on-going project at the eppi-centre, which had a large vol-ume of items to be screened (>38,000) but with a verytight timeframe, has taken advantage of this benefit [67].', ').there are also potential benefits for review updates.cohen stated that ‘by reviewing the most likely import-ant documents before other documents, the human re-viewers or curators are more likely to be able to “get upto speed” on the current developments within a domainmore quickly’ ([68] p. 121).', 'in quite a different applica-tion of text mining to the screening process, cohen laterexplored the use of prioritisation for identifying when areview update was required, which would involve send-ing alerts to the review team when likely relevant newstudies are published [69].in other words, this approach emphasises improvingworkflow in a review and has proposed benefits for effi-ciency beyond reducing workload in the title and abstractscreening phase.', 'four studies adopted a prioritisation ap-proach to improve workflow [58,66,68,69].', 'all four evalua-tions reported benefits of this approach.note that screening prioritisation can also be used toreduce the number of items needed to be screened if ascreening cut-off criterion is established (see section onthis workload reduction approach, above).', 'seven studiesthat have used screening prioritisation did so to reducethe number needed to screen and reported benefits interms of the amount of work saved [31,52-57].', '(again,the metrics and processes varied, so it is not possible toestimate overall or mean statistics across these studies).specific issues relating to the use of text mining insystematic reviewsin this section, we address research question 3: howhave key contextual problems of applying text mining tosystematic review screening been addressed?', 'these reflectthe challenges that need to be addressed when applyingmethods developed for other applications to the case ofsystematic review screening.the importance of high recall for systematic reviewsas mentioned in the ‘background’ section, recall is oftenprioritised over precision in systematic reviews.', 'this isbecause it is generally considered to be critical to re-trieve all relevant items to avoid biasing the review find-ings.', 'the importance of high recall of relevant studies islikely to be critical in the acceptability and uptake of textmining techniques by the systematic review community.indeed, the authors of one paper reflected that ‘if thosewho rely on systematic review to develop guidelines andco’mara-eves et al.', 'systematic reviews 2015, 4:5http://www.systematicreviewsjournal.com/content/4/1/5page 10 of 22policy demand 100% recall and informatics approachessuch as ours are not able to guarantee 100% recall, theapproaches may be doomed’ ([23] p. 15).many of the studies in this review explicitly refer tothe importance of high recall and the implications itmight have for text mining applications in this area(studies which discuss the importance of high recall in-clude [11,23,24,30,38,40,41,44,48,49,53,54,58,60,61,70]).however, few of the studies directly built into the technol-ogy an approach to maximising recall.', 'those that did dir-ectly attempt to maximise recall are discussed below.voting or committee approaches for ensuring high recallone approach to ensuring that studies are not missed isto use a voting or committee approach.', 'essentially, mul-tiple classifiers are run simultaneously, and then a ‘vote’is taken on each item to determine whether it is likely tobe relevant or not.', 'a conservative approach would be toput forward for human screening any item that receives atleast one ‘include vote’ (e.g., wallace et al.', '[11]); an ap-proach that places additional emphasis on precision mightset a minimum number of agreeing votes (e.g., >50% ofthe classifiers must agree that an item is an include [44]).the appeal of such approaches is that the classificationdecision is less susceptible to missing studies that do notresemble the training set of includes, because each clas-sifier can start with a different training set.', 'several stud-ies have used this approach, with different numbers ofclassifiers used in the committee.', 'razavi used a commit-tee of five classifiers [44]; wallace and frunza used (upto) eleven classifiers [11,24,61]; ma used two classifiers[40].', 'only frunza has considered whether the numberof votes makes a difference, as discussed below [24,61].in frunza (2010), if at least one decision for an ab-stract was to include it in the systematic review, thenlabel was ‘included’ [24].', 'they then testedthe finalwhether the number of votes (i.e., number of classifiers)made a difference to recall and precision.', 'they con-cluded that the 2-vote technique is superior to the othervoting techniques (1-vote, 3-vote, 4-vote) in terms of thef measure and work saved over sampling (wss).', 'thehighest level of recall was achieved through the 4-votetechnique.', 'the success of combined human-machinescreening was similar in their later study [61], with theconclusion that the 2-vote technique was the best per-former.', 'importantly, frunza noted that precision de-creased slightly when the human decisions were addedto the machine decisions (i.e., the human incorrectly in-cluded some items).', 'this might be relevant to the obser-vation that human screeners tend to be over-inclusive(discussed in a later section).(we will return to the issue of‘voting’ approachesbelow, in the section on ‘hasty generalisation’).specialist algorithmsat least three types of classifiers have been modified to in-clude a specialist algorithm that adjusts the learning rateof the classifier to penalise false negatives.', 'cohen et al.', 'ap-plied a ‘false negative learning rate’ to their voting percep-tron classifier expressing this as a ‘cost-proportionaterejection sampling’ strategy [36].', 'matwin et al.', 'added aheuristic weight factorization technique to their comple-ment naïve bayes (cnb) algorithm to maximise recallwhen their original algorithm had unacceptably low recall(<95%) [41].', 'bekhuis also modified a complement naïvebayes classifier by optimising the decision parametersusing f3: a summary measure of performance that over-weights recall relative to precision [60].', 'wallace and col-leagues modified their support vector machine approachto penalise more severely for false negatives comparedwith false positives [48].all of these studies were retrospective evaluations inwhich the performance of a classifier was comparedagainst completed include decisions and all reportedgood results in terms of recall and workload reduction.future evaluations ofthis approach should considerwhether the amount and/or quality of the training datamake a difference to the ability of these modifications toadequately penalise false negatives.', 'the reason for this isthat, if used in a ‘live’ review, there might be only a smallnumber of human-labelled items in the training set tobe able to determine whether the classifier has incor-rectly rejected a relevant study.', 'if there are only a smallnumber of includable studies in the entire dataset, thensuch penalties might not be implementable.human inputma proposed using active learning as a method for as-suring high recall [40].', 'the logic behind this is that thealgorithm continues to ‘learn’ as more items are manu-ally screened and so the decision rule is adaptable andless reliant on the initial training set.', 'however, ma’s [40]results suggest that recall actually declined when activelearning was added to a support vector machine or deci-sion tree classifier and made no difference to the recallof a naïve bayes classifier.', 'further research on this isneeded to determine why this might be the case.hasty generalisationthe term ‘hasty generalisation’ refers to a bias which canoccur because the features in the training set are notrepresentative of the population; as opposed to other‘biased training sets’ (e.g.', 'where bias occursforms offrom non-randomised sampling).', 'if the initial trainingset of documents in a systematic review is not fully rep-resentative of the range of documents which are of inter-est, it is

to inject a systematic bias whichwould be unacceptable in the vast majority of reviews.several methods for dealing with this have been evalu-ated or discussed: drawing on reviewer domain know-ledge, using patient active learning methods andemploying an ensemble of classifiers that vote onwhether an item should be included or not.', 'these areelaborated on in the following sections.reviewer domain knowledgesome studies evaluated or discussed drawing on theknowledge of the human reviewers to play a part in thetext mining process.', 'this is particularly suited to activelearning approaches.', 'jonnalagadda and colleagues sug-gested that, in active learning, ‘the dynamically changingquery set, which decides which document will be pre-sented next, could be easily modified at any stage by re-moving or adding terms to the query set.', 'in this way,the possibility of not finding documents that use differ-ent words could be further minimised by allowing activeparticipation of the users in defining the terms in thequery set’ ([23] p. 15).', 'they did not, however, test thisapproach empirically.in addition to other text mining methods, shemiltet al.', 'employed an approach that used ‘reviewer terms’(terms specified by the review team as being indicativeof an includable or excludable study) [31].', 'the text con-tained in each title-abstract record that was yet to bescreened was analysed and the number of relevant andirrelevant terms they contained was calculated.', 'a simpleratio of these values was then generated, and items wereranked according to this ratio.', 'the authors argue that‘the purpose of this method is to act as a counterpointto the automated technologies; whereas in atr [auto-matic term recognition] and ac [automatic classifica-tion], the results are heavily determined by those studiesalready identified as being relevant; rt [reviewer terms]offers another perspective on potential relevance, offer-ing some protection againstthe problem of hastygeneralization’ ([31] p. 45).', 'this might offer reassuranceto review teams that no relevant items are being errone-ously discarded and is an easy approach to implement ifthe reviewers are familiar with the key terminology.a more holistic approach was evaluated by wallaceet al.', '[25].', 'as in shemilt et al.', '(above), reviewers pro-vided terms that were indicative of includes and excludes(although the terms were ranked in order of ‘indicative-ness’ in the wallace paper).', 'wallace et al.', 'suggested thatcombining prior reviewer knowledge with the machinemodel could be more effective at avoiding hasty general-isation and tested a variety of combinations in terms ofthe timing at which the reviewer knowledge rankingswere emphasised relative to the machine labelling.', 'theyconcluded that beginning with a bias towards the reviewerrankings and subsequently decreasing its importance as la-belling proceeds would be the most effective way of com-bining reviewer domain knowledge in the process; however,they also noted ‘how this should be done precisely remainsa problem for future work’ ([25] p. 8).in addition, in a study which came to light after ourformal searches were complete, small et al.', 'utilised re-viewer ‘labelled features’ within what they called a ‘con-strained weight space svm’ [71].', 'they found that, byallowing reviewers to influence the decisions made bythe classifier, it is possible to obtain better results withsmaller samples of training records.patient active learning‘patient active learning’ was first proposed by wallaceet al.', 'as a means of overcoming hasty generalisation usingan active learning approach [11].', 'the distinguishing fea-ture of ‘patient’ active learning is that training is based ondifferent ‘views’ of the records (e.g.', 'classifiers based on ti-tles or abstract or mesh terms) which are selected at ran-dom at each iteration of the active learning process.', 'theadditional variability that this approach injects into theprocess above the use of a single ‘view’ aims to ensure thatthe system as a whole is exposed to as wide a variety ofrelevant studies as possible and thus does not overly nar-row the range of items it considers to be relevant.wallace and colleagues evaluated four different activelearning strategies and found that patient active learningoutperformed the others [11].', 'in a study which repli-cated some of wallace’s work on the same data, miwaand colleagues evaluated a range of active learning en-hancements and found that patient active learning is cer-tainly better than some strategies, though not as good asothers [45].voting or committee approaches for dealing with hastygeneralisationthe concept of a committee of classifiers was earlier in-troduced for helping to ensure high recall.', 'given thathasty generalisation would logically lead to lower recall,it is unsurprising that this approach has also been sug-gested as a solution to hasty generalisation.two studies explicitly refer to this approach.', 'miwaet al.', 'reported that voting showed some improvementover non-voting approaches, especially for one particu-larly ‘messy’ dataset with respect to the terminology usedin that review topic [45].', 'shemilt et al.', 'did not comparevoting with non-voting approaches but ran the classifiermultiple times and then manually screened only thoseitems that were consistently classified as being relevant[31].', 'this approach seems likely to have increased preci-sion at the expense of sensitivity.co’mara-eves et al.', 'systematic reviews 2015, 4:5http://www.systematicreviewsjournal.com/content/4/1/5page 12 of 22dealing with imbalanced datasetsat the title and abstract screening stage of a typical sys-tematic review, the dataset is imbalanced in that there areusually far more excluded studies than included studies.one paper reported a median search precision (number ofincluded studies divided by total number of items locatedthrough searching) of 2.9% across 94 health-related sys-tematic reviews [72].', 'this translates to an imbalance inwhich there are approximately 33.5 times as many ex-cludes as includes.',

des-ignation as an include or an exclude).', 'it is a problem fortext mining as there are far fewer relevant items com-pared to non-relevant items on which to train the classi-fier or text mining technology.', 'also, wallace et al.', 'statethat ‘class imbalance presents a problem for classifica-tion algorithms, because they have typically been opti-mised for accuracy, rather than the recall of a particularclass’ ([11] p. 5).', 'since it is possible to have high accur-acy even if a system produces many false negatives [73],this could be a problem for systematic reviews wheremissing relevant studies is highly undesirable.to counter the class imbalance, various methods havebeen proposed.', 'they generally rely on up-weighting thenumber of includes or down-weighting the number ofexcludes; or undersampling the number of excludes usedin the training set.', 'the various approaches are describedin the following sections.weightingweighting approaches assign greater weights to positiveinstances (includes)than to negative instances (ex-cludes).', 'generally, the weight is set to the ratio of thenumber of positive instances to the number of negativeinstances.compared to an un-weighted method or an aggressiveundersampling method (described below), miwa et al.reported better performance of active learning modelson a variety of imbalanced datasets [45].', 'this was par-ticularly the case when weighting was used in conjunc-tion with a ‘certainty’ approach, in which the next itemsto be annotated in the active learning process were se-lected because they had the highest probability of beingrelevant to the review, based on the output of classifierstrained on previously annotated items.cohen et al.', 'also reported good results for a weightedmodel, in which they modified their voting perceptronclassifier to incorporate a false negative learning rate(fnlr) [36].', 'across 15 reviews, they found that the fnlrshould be proportional to the ratio of negative

theirprevalence in the entire dataset.', 'two different types ofundersampling have been tested in this context: randomand aggressive.random undersampling involves randomly selecting atraining set with the same number of relevant and non-relevant studies.', 'this approach was adopted in four stud-ies that did not compare random undersampling to othermethods for dealing with class imbalance

involved removing those examples thatparticipated in tomek links (see [74] for a definition);method 5 involved selecting negative examples randomly.ma concluded that random undersampling did not per-form the best.', '‘in general, the first and third undersamplingmethods work well with all feature selection methods.', 'wehave a very high recall after performing undersamplingtechniques.', 'however, we have a big trade-off in precision’([40] p. 75).aggressive undersampling as defined by wallace (inthe context of active learning) involves discarding themajority examples (i.e., excludes) nearest the currentseparating hyperplane [11].', 'the separating hyperplanerepresents the border between the two classes: includesand excludes.', 'therefore, by throwing away those nearestto the hyperplane, we are discarding those that are themost ambiguous as to whether they should be in the in-clude or exclude class.', 'as such, the items that are morelikely to be excludes are sent to the human reviewer formanual screening, which are then used to retrain the clas-sifier.', 'the logic behind this approach is to ‘explicitly pushthe decision boundary away from the minority class [in-cludes], as it has been observed that when there is classimbalance, svms are prone to discovering hyperplanesthat are closer to the minority class than the ideal separat-ing boundary, resulting in false negatives’ ([11] p. 5).wallace (2010a) [11] compared naive random sam-pling and aggressive undersampling in their evaluationof active learning with an svm classifier.', 'they con-cluded that aggressive undersampling performed better[11].', 'miwa et al.', 'compared aggressive undersamplingwith a range of other options and found that whilst itoutperformed the other strategies at the

nontopic data arerejection sampled, that is, sampled without replacement.the probabilities of inclusion for each sample within agiven nontopic are adjusted so that approximately thesame number of samples from each nontopic is included.’in their experiments they used 20 resamples.other methods for dealing with class imbalancesome authors claimed that certain classifiers are particu-larly well suited to imbalanced datasets.', 'bekhuis frunza,kouznetsov and matwin claimed that complement naïvebayes (cnb) is suitable for imbalanced data, particularlywhen implemented in weka [24,30,41,54,60,61].', 'frunzaand colleagues compared cnb with other classifiers (de-cision trees, support vector machine,instance-basedlearning and boosting) but concluded that cnb alwaysperformed better; it is not clear, however, whether this isbecause of the class imbalance problem or other differ-ences between the approaches [24,61].some authors have suggested that the selection of fea-tures for text mining might be important in addressingclass imbalances.', 'although they did not test it in theirpaper, bekhuis et al.', 'suggested that selecting featureswithin the positive (include) and negative (exclude) classesbefore grid optimization, rather than across allitems,would be appropriate for dealing with class imbalance [30].frunza explicitly compared classifiers that had been‘boosted’ in terms of having more representative featuresfor the included class (a balanced dataset) with typical fea-ture selection technique (imbalanced dataset) but found nosignificant difference between these two approaches [24].updates versus ‘new’ reviewsout of the 44 studies, the context of 36 was a new re-view, eight a review update, and for two studies the re-view context was not the primary area of investigation(the issue was the performance of classifiers).', 'the con-text of new reviews is challenging, because there is so lit-tle training material available at the start of screening onwhich to conduct any machine learning.', 'whilst the con-cept of obtaining an unbiased set of training materialusing a random sample is widely employed, wallace andcolleagues have outlined an explicit iterative method todetermine whether the variation in likely ‘includes’ hasbeen explored adequately enough for active learning tobegin [11].', 'they do this drawing on the work of brinkerwho has developed methods for incorporating diversityin active learning by evaluating the stability of a measureof similarity between ‘included’ citations between itera-tions [75].', 'once the measure of similarity ceases tochange between iterations, the sample can be consideredready to perform active learning.in contrast, whilst the review update might appear tobe the more straightforward situation, since there arepreexisting citation decisions on which to ‘learn’, someof the earliest work included in our review—by cohen—shows that review updates face many challenges of their‘conceptown [35,66,68,69].', 'in particular, the issue ofdrift’ looms large over the review update.', 'as bekhuispoints out, there are many changing variables in a re-view update—the team, the searches and even aspects ofthe question may all change—and the data from the ori-ginal review may cease to be a reliable indicator of whatshould be included in the new one [60].', 'dalal and col-leagues attempted to mitigate the effects of concept driftbut were not entirely successful [70].additional information on this topiconline learning methods which treat datasets as astream, updating their model for each

suitable for all evaluationdesigns or text mining technology types.', 'for instance,coverage is only suitable for active learning approaches,whilst cohen noted that ‘if the task is not to separate doc-uments into positive and negative groups, but instead toprioritise which documents should be reviewed first andwhich later, then precision, recall and f measure do notprovide sufficient information’ (p. 121) [68].measures that allow the trade-off between recall andprecision to be taken into account on a review-by-review basis seem particularly useful, as they allow re-viewers to change the relative importance of these twometrics depending on priorities in a given review.', 'thesemetrics include notably the f measure, work saved oversampling and utility, which are summarised below.f measure is a weighted harmonic mean of precisionand recall.', 'the weighting can be determined on a review-by-review basis, allowing reviewers to assess the relativeimportance of recall and

whilst it reduces the resources required to screenitems, 100% of the items identified through searchingare still viewed by a human screener.', 'this could combatconcerns about false negatives assigned by an automatedscreener.', 'a further potential benefit of such a system isthat it ‘could deliver quality assurance both by confirm-ing concordant decisions and by naming studies associ-ated with discordant decisions for further consideration’(bekhuis [60], p. 9) (one possible weakness of this ap-proach is that it necessarily assumes that any mistakesmade by the human screener are essentially at random,and not because of some systematic misapplication ofthe inclusion criteria, which might be picked up and ad-dressed if two reviewers were working in tandem.', ').reducing workload by increasing the rate (or speed) ofscreening was a little researched topic, exclusively lim-ited to the visual data mining approach and largelychampioned by one research group.', 'a major limitationof these evaluations—and potentially for the wider ap-plicability of these approaches—is that the approach hasonly been tested on very small datasets.', 'the largest data-set consisted of only 261 items

allows fora human sense-check of the terminology preferencesdetermined by the machine.one important distinction to make when evaluatingthe utility of machine learning in screening is whetherone is creating a new review or updating and existingone.', 'given the existence of the preexisting data for re-view updates, it is often possible to know in advance thelikely performance of using text mining, enabling re-viewers to make an informed decision about its potentialin that specific review.', 'such a situation does not pertainin new reviews, and the risk of hasty generalisation is a‘known

general effectiveness of these technologies.', 'certainly,where technical jargon is utilised, most approaches ap-pear to offer efficiency savings; and in the few instancesof their application outside

fifth research question considered the challengesto implementation that emerged from reviewing the evi-dence base.', 'here, we found few deployed systems, whichlimits the ability of reviewers to try out these technolo-gies, but also, given the limitations in the evidence baseidentified above, there is probably a need for specialistadvice whenever they are used in a live review—and cer-tainly if

of abstracts to theprocessing of full text, but note that there are opportun-ities to be exploited in so doing [87].', 'text mining technol-ogy has, however, improved greatly since that publication.there are now text mining systems that process largeamounts of full text and that support sophisticated seman-tic search.', 'for example, europe pubmed central, a largearchive for the life
